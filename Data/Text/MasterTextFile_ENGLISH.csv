MB_LAND_PLANET_FELUCIA_TUTORIAL,Located in the Outer Rim, Felucia was once a major holding of the Commerce Guild. A challenging world to colonize, Felucia was a world teeming with fungal life-forms and immense primitive plants. Much of the planet has a fetid, humid landscape overgrown by forests of bizarre wilderness. Many of the indigenous plants aggressively defend themselves. Sharp barbs, shooting spores, and poisonous defenses scuttled early attempts at agriculture. The hardships of settlement produced few cities of note on Felucia, including Kway Teow, Har Gau and Niango. Felucia has become an exotic retreat for the wealthy and the poorly paid citizens who support their extravagant whims.

MB_LAND_PLANET_SALEUCAMI_INTIMIDATION,Governor Koong Eeth must be intimidated for the corruption of Saleucami to proceed. Maiming Eeth, and putting him in the hospital for several months regenerating his body parts, will put across the message that he should accommodate the Zann Consortium's special needs.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal. 
MB_LAND_PLANET_SHOLA_02,Jabba thought that he could absorb all my planets and take control of the Consortium.  Shola was one of my storage houses for contraband, and Jabba wasted no time in stealing everything I had there.  Unfortunately, Urai chose Shola as the hiding place for the Sith Artifact - we need to get it back and destroy Jabba's forces before they manage to uncover it.
MB_LAND_PLANET_TARIS_INTIMIDATION,A Gungan Duelist named Twitch is the perfect target for intimidation. If the Zann Consortium can frighten him, the rest of the world will fall quickly. Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.

MB_SPACE_PLANET_KESSEL_PIRACY,Kessel is infamous for its political prisons which require massive communication satellites to maintain proper order.  These satellites are weak to an assault by our Defilers. Controlling them will trick Consortium enemies into sending ships to Zann controlled docks. Tariffs that would have been paid while moving through the system will be paid to the Zann Consortium instead.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal. 
MB_SPACE_PLANET_MANDALORE_PIRACY,Piracy is going to be especially dangerous to set up around Mandalore. I will have to personally take charge to make this mission work against the vicious inhabitants of Mandalore and their brand of space fighters.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal. 
MB_SPACE_PLANET_MANDALORE_PIRACY_PROLOGUE,Piracy is going to be especially dangerous to set up around Mandalore.

MB_SPACE_PLANET_MONCALAMARI_PIRACY,The Mon Calamari are famed for their star cruisers. These have to be met by Consortium forces to see how powerful they really are.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.  
MBEM02_An_Organized_Resistance.TED,Darth Vader has been sent to the planet Thyferra by the Emperor to track down the Imperial agent conspiring with the Rebels.  Tracing coded transmissions, Vader leads an Imperial assault force to the surface, hoping to catch Rebels, and more importantly his target, off guard.  
MBEM03_The_Pirate_Menace.TED,Boba Fett has been hired for a hefty price to aid the Empire.  He will scout the pirate defenses and neutralize their warning systems before the main fleet enters the area.  
MBEM04_Space_Planet_Geonosis.TED,Grand Moff Tarkin has assigned Darth Vader to acquire the resources of the planet Geonosis.  To take full control of the planet, both space and land must be secured.  
MBEM05_Attack_on_Mon_Calamari.TED,The Emperor believes that the fiercely-independent people of Mon Calamari will inevitably aid the Rebellion if they are allowed the choice.  The planet must be subjugated to prevent their interference.  
MBEM06_Trouble_on_Kashyyyk.TED,A passionate rogue named Solo who had defected from the Empire some time ago has freed the Wookiees from their prisons.  In his irrational defiance, he is attempting to get them off-planet.  We cannot afford to lose the labor force we have established on Kashyyyk.
MBEM09_A_New_Weapon_of_War.TED,With progress on the Death Star proceeding on schedule, the Emperor has turned his attention to other weapons.

The demonstration is to be held on Carida, home to an important Imperial training facility.

MBEXECUTIVE_TACTICAL_DEMO,Located in the Moddell sector of the Outer Rim, this silvery gas giant planet is orbited by nine moons. The largest moon is the size of a small planet and is known as the forest moon or simply Endor. It is covered by savannas, mountains and woodlands with trees that reach thousands of meters in height. A wide range of intelligent creatures inhabit Endor, from the vicious and towering Gorax to the courageous Ewoks. The Ewoks build their sprawling villages in Endor's trees that are connected by suspended bridges, ropes and wooden platforms. Ewoks are deceptively innocuous, but are keen warriors and hunters capable of using their ingenuity and natural surroundings to their advantage.
MBEXECUTIVE_TACTICAL_DEMO1,A temperate planet in the Chommell Sector of the Mid Rim, Naboo is covered by thick swamps, rolling plains, and green hills. Unlike many other planets, Naboo lacks a molten core. Instead, the planet's innards are composed of a massive honeycomb structure filled with water. The planet is also home to numerous animal species and is inhabited by the peaceful Naboo and the more warlike Gungans. The Naboo typically populate striking cities such as Theed, while the Gungans dwell in exotic bubble cities hidden in lakes and swamps. Both the Naboo and the Gungans oppose the Emperor.
MBRM01_Space_Planet_Kuat.TED,Unable to get to Fresia directly, Captain Antilles decides to stage a diversionary attack on the Imperial shipyards at Kuat - a massive installation that constructs all types of Imperial craft.  Normally heavily defended, the Incom nationalization ceremony has reassigned the majority of its defensive fleet, leaving the shipyard vulnerable.  Antilles hopes to cause enough damage to draw the Imperial Star Destroyer Tyranny away from Fresia, leaving their real target unguarded... .
MBRM02_Interpreting_the_Network.TED,Undaunted by the setback in their plans to steal the X-wings, the Alliance devises a scheme to fool the Imperial sensors scattered around Fresia.  An Imperial network uplink station on Wayland seems like the ideal way to steal codes for the Imperial sensors if R2-D2 can get to it unharmed.  With the network fooled, the Alliance can slip past Fresia's defenses with the Empire none the wiser... .
MBRM03_Theft_of_the_X-wing.TED,Unwilling to let the X-wings fall into the Empire's hands, some Incom scientists have provided the Alliance with the location of the prototype craft.  With nationalization only a few days away, the Alliance doesn't have a moment to spare.  Soon the Imperials will descend on Fresia and seize the X-wings for its own growing military force.  The Alliance realizes that this will not be an easy task.  The facility is heavily guarded, and it won't take long for the Empire to realize what they're up to... .
MBRM04_Kessel_Rescue,The infamous spice mines of Kessel are death sentences to any prisoners of the Empire sent to work there.  Receiving word that Incom's scientists and other Rebel supporters are being transferred to the facility, the Alliance wastes no time in staging a rescue before the prisoners can reach the mines.  Using the ion attack ability of the Y-wings, the Alliance can disable the shuttles, then Captain Antilles in the Sundered Heart can swoop in and liberate the prisoners before they reach Kessel!
MBRM06_Imperial_Liberation,Intercepting communications chatter from a developing situation on Kashyyyk, the Alliance learns of a raid being led on Wookiee containment facilities the Empire has established.   Wookiees are being released from confinement and arming themselves.  The Alliance must act to assist in any action that would free citizens from the clutches of the Empire.
MBRM07_Highest_Bidder,Dealing with the seedy underworld is always a risk, and this time the fate of the Alliance hangs in the balance.  A disgruntled associate of one of the Alliance's contacts has stolen critical data about their dealings, and is offering it up to the Empire... for a price.  
MBRM07A_Rescue_Falcon,No sooner does Han get away from the Alliance than he's back in hot water with the Imperials.  Caught in a Star Destroyer's tractor beam while running illicit goods to Corulag, it's only a matter of time before his engines burn out and the Empire boards his ship.  The Alliance moves quickly to rescue him in the hopes of acquiring his services for a mission that only a smuggler could handle... .
MBRM08A_Cargo_Woes,Typically, Han Solo would be stealing things from depots like this one - not adding things to them.  This particular staging area resupplies fleets from all over the sector, and traffic through it is heavy.  There are more Imperial ships passing through here per day than most systems will see in a year.  Cargo containers bound for a multitude of systems float around the facility, easy pickings for those that know how to circumvent the security.  The Alliance hopes that Han is one of those in the know.  
MBRM09_Borrowed_Time,Following the trail of information on this new Imperial superweapon, the Alliance has pinpointed one of Grand Moff Tarkin's research stations as a likely source of further information.  The cargo container Han Solo planted the EMP on has reached its destination.  Now, the Alliance assembles its fleet and gets ready to assault the station.  Shortly before entering the system, the Alliance detonates the EMP device attached to the cargo container.  Hopefully there will be enough time to search the station before the Imperial fleet responds... .
MBRM09_Lost_and_Found,Han Solo and Chewbacca have once again found themselves performing yet another dangerous assignment for the Alliance.  This time, it's infiltrating a heavily fortified Imperial city… on foot.  Their goal is to find the schematics that the Empire has annexed.  Recovering these schematics may just be what the Alliance needs to get the Mon Calamari back into the fight.  Han and Chewie must work together to navigate the city, avoid or neutralize the Imperials encountered, and reach the supply dock, where they can recover the plans and steal a ship to get them off-world.

MBTM07_SPACE_MULTIPLAYER,Teaches the basic game play behind the Space Skirmish game modes.
MBUM01_A_CRIMELORD_UNLEASHED,Jabba used his Imperial contacts to get me thrown in prison. I've been in long enough to gain control of the gangs inside, at the cost of my own Zann Consortium organization almost totally destroyed on the outside. I've ordered my lieutenant, Urai Fen, to get a fast ship here and he's three days out. I'm going to escape and exact my revenge on Jabba and the Empire.
MBUM02_REMNANTS_OF_THE_DEATH_STAR,It seems the Rebels went and blew up the Emperor's Death Star while I was busy rebuilding in another part of the galaxy.  Lucky for me the corpse is relatively fresh, and the scavengers have yet to pick it clean.  If the crew ejected the data pods, and if I can recover them before the Rebels, they just might contain information on the Emperor's hidden vaults....
MBUM03_COMMUNICATIONS_BREAKDOWN,Jabba the Hutt found a way to break into Tyber's communications system.  Luckily Tyber's techs managed to trace the signal to a relay station on Saleucami.  Jabba needs to be taught a lesson. I will use my strike team to establish a beachhead, so that our land forces can take Saleucami out from under him.
MBUM04_VISIONS_OF_THE_PAST,Jabba the Hutt has uncovered an old Clone Wars era factory built by the Geonosians that was never found by the old Republic.  If I can get there first, I can take a large prize out of Jabba's slimy hands, and gain a lot of firepower in the bargain.  Urai has gone ahead to scout while I gather some reinforcements.  What could possibly go wrong?
MBUM06_DARK_ALLY,I'm landing on Dathomir to search for a Dark Force user to unlock the Sith Artifact. I'm surprised to see the planet under strict Empire control. It seems there are many secrets here the Emperor himself wants to keep hidden. It will be interesting to see what Urai and I can find....
MBUM07_CLOUD_CITY_CONFLICT,Darth Vader commands the forces on Bespin. I'm hoping to plant clues in the raid for the gas to make the Empire think Prince Xizor of the Black Sun is responsible. I want the gas for the ships I can build with it. Also the code breaking IG-88 can do for me is vital to the completion of my plan....
MBUM08_REBEL_EVICTION,I need to set up a new ship production facility in the Vergesso Asteroids, but the Rebels already have a foothold in that location.  The Rebellion is easily frightened by a show of Imperial force, so I've sent Urai in some stolen Imperial ships to deal with them.  I get the territory and I put the blame on the Empire to deflect any fallout - a flawless plan!
MBUM09_BAITING_THE_HOOK,According to my plans I'm meeting the Imperial contact on Carida, supposedly to sell the Sith artifact.  I'm naturally expecting a double cross by everyone I'm meeting. After all, it's what I would do if I were meeting them.  But a trap you know about is one you can use to your advantage....
MBUM11_RAIDERS_OF_THE_LOST_HOLOCRON,Urai, Silri, and I are raiding the Imperial Archive on Coruscant. I'm going to get the Emperor's personal passkey. I realize fully that Silri is going to be a problem, but for now I'll just watch her closely and make sure she does my bidding….
MBUM12_THE_EMPERORS_NEW_WEAPON,The Emperor's passkey is the key to unlocking my prize - the Emperor's vaults and enough wealth to gain control of the galaxy's criminal underworld.  All I have to do is fight my way through the remaining Imperial ships, not to mention fending off whatever Rebel forces come to investigate...

TEXT_CAMPAIGN_DIVIDER_SINGLE_ERAS,=== HISTORIC CONFLICTS ==============================
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_DAALA_NEWREPUBLIC,In order to progress to the next era, Natasi Daala must die or 80 weeks must elapse.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_ERAS_DISCLAIMER,Before completing era change objectives, keep in mind that era progression is not necessarily always favourable. Consider your options carefully before proceeding. After a certain amount of time, the era change will atuomatically occur with the same effects as the leader's death in combat.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_ERAS_NEWREPUBLIC,The New Republic progresses through the eras by killing the Imperial leader, with some exceptions. The era can also progress automatically after 80 ingame weeks. As the eras change, the New Republic will gain and lose access to different time-appropriate units and heroes. To progress to the second half of era 1, the Empire must lose Sate Pestage, Coruscant, or 80 weeks must elapse.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_ISARD_NEWREPUBLIC,To progress to era 2, the Isard must be killed or 60 weeks must elapse.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_JAX_NEWREPUBLIC,In order to progress to era 4, Carnor Jax must be killed or 60 weeks must elapse.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PALPATINE_NEWREPUBLIC,To progress to the second half of era 3, Palpatine must be killed or 80 weeks must elapse.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PELLAEON_NEWREPUBLIC,This is the final era.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_DAALA_VOLUNTARY,If you complete the build option Daala will take command of Imperial forces from the Gorgon.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_JAX_DEATH,If you do not help Jax, Palpatine will remain in your forces for 60 weeks or until his death.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_JAX_VOLUNTARY,If you progress by helping Jax and completing the build option, you get his set of heroes sooner. (Other benefits in later versions)
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_PALPATINE_DEATH,If Thrawn dies or 60 weeks pass before you complete the build option, Thrawn will leave your service and the Ciutric Hegemony will secede [Ciutric and surrounding planets]
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_PALPATINE_VOLUNTARY,Upon completion of the relevant build option, Palpatine will join your forces. The Eclipse can be constructed with a level 4 shipyard at Byss.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_PELLAEON_DEATH,If Daala dies or 60 weeks pass before the build option is completed, you will receive fewer heroes in the next era.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_PELLAEON_VOLUNTARY,If you complete the build option, Pellaeon will take command of the Imperial forces, and Daala will return to your service with other forces later.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROGRESS_THRAWN_VOLUNTARY,Completing the era progression build option will cause Isard to leave the Empire (with Lusankya) and Thrawn to join. This will open new build options and provide new heroes for the Imperial Remnant, New Republic, and Empire of the Hand (if present). After 60 weeks, this switch will happen automatically.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROJECT_AMBITION_FAILURE,If Project Ambition is not completed before Sate Pestage's death or the fall of Coruscant, Isard will take command of the Empire without additional heroes under her command.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROJECT_AMBITION_SUCCESS,If you complete Project Ambition before Coruscant falls or Sate Pestage dies in battle, Ysanne Isard and the Lusankya will come under your command with a larger roster of heroes [ Ait Convarion, Afsheen Makati and Miltin Takel ]
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_PROJECT_AMBITION_ZEROCOMMAND,After Project Ambition, the fall of Coruscant, or Sate Pestage's death, Zero Command will take control of the following planets if the Empire controls them: Kalist VI, Abregado-Rae
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_EVENT_THRAWN_NEWREPUBLIC,To progress to era 3, Thrawn must be killed or 60 weeks must elapse. After Thrawn's death, there will be 15 weeks before era 3 begins.

TEXT_CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE_BALMORRA_MISSION_DESCRIPTION,Bring Wedge Antilles or Lando Calrissian to Balmorra to hide a strike force in a weapons shipment to Byss.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE_BALMORRA_MISSION_DIALOG,Mon Mothma: Governor Beltane of Balmorra has proposed the dangerous plan of smuggling a strike team in one of the weapons shipments the Empire has coerced from him. The war machines can be activated deep in enemy territory, far beyond where our own fleet to take them. Generals Antilles and Calrissian have volunteered to assemble the strike force if we can bring either to Balmorra.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE_BALMORRA_MISSION_LOST,Mon Mothma: Today, among so much other death, me must take a moment to remember the brave soldiers who took the chance of infiltrating the heart of darkness. They risked all in a slim chance to deal a great blow to the Empire, but all war is uncertain, and those brave souls have paid the ultimate price.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE_BALMORRA_MISSION_SET_OUT,Zevulon Veers: We're hidden and on our way. The transit will take some time, but the Imperials won't know what hit them when we arrive.

TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12,Heart of the Maw
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12_INTRO_E,The Empire wishes to use the Maw as a location for a research facility.  Both the Rebellion and the Zann Consortium also wish to use the location for their own purposes.  The Emperor instructs you to capture the Maw along with four other key planets to further his plans.  You have 60 galactic days to do this - fail at your own peril.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12_INTRO_R,We wish to wrest control of the Maw from the Zann Consortium; the location is ideal for a refuge due to the difficulty in navigating the area.  It would also be beneficial to the Alliance if we were to control four other key planets.  However, the Empire is attempting to interfere with our plans - we only have 60 galactic days to take control, or we lose everything.  May the Force be with you!
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12_INTRO_U,The Maw is a location that attracts attention from all sides; the Empire wishes to produce a research facility in the location, while the Rebellion wants to use it as a refuge.  I want it because they want it.  With the Maw under consortium control along with four other key locations, my power will be absolute.  But we only have 60 days before the plan fails.  See to it!
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15,The Shipyards of Kuat
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20,Pirate Dominance
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21,Origin of Corruption
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_E,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, there is a new force working in the background of the galaxy.  The Empire will not tolerate any interference - crush all who oppose us.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_R,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, there is a new force working in the background of the galaxy.  We must unite the galaxy against the evils of the Empire, while not falling to the temptations of the Zann Consortium.  May the Force be with you!
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_U,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, there is a new force working in the background of the galaxy.  The galaxy is ripe for the picking.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25,Empire Surrounded
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_27,Gateways
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_27_INTRO_U,The battle rages on for the galaxy.  We are separated from our enemies by a few core planets.  The struggle for the galaxy will hinge on the control of these planets.  Use your starting resources wisely in order to conquer the galaxy.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30,Roles Reversed
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B,Clusters
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B_INTRO_E,The fools in the Rebellion and the Zann Consortium seek my life.  Let them play their games - I will play the rabbit for now while you go and seek their deaths instead.  Conquer Yavin 4 and Endor, and bring me proof that Mon Mothma and Tyber Zann will bother the Empire no longer.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B_INTRO_R,The Empire and the Zann Consortium have put a price on my head.  While I hate resorting to assassination at any time, it seems we have no choice in the matter.  Take control of Coruscant and Endor, and see that Emperor Palpatine and Tyber Zann are brought to justice.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B_INTRO_U,It is a dire time for the Zann Consortium.  With our major successes all across the galaxy, both the Rebellion and the Empire have put a price on my head.  If they wish to challenge me, then we will play their game.  Assassinate Mon Mothma and Emperor Palpatine, and take control of their current bases of operation: Yavin 4 and Coruscant.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35,Empire at War
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36,Rim World Conflict
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36_INTRO_E,While the heart of the Empire is relatively secure, the Outer Rim is a constant plague of corruption and disorder.  The Emperor wants the worlds of the Rim under control and his laws enforced; with the Rim in his control the Rebels and criminals will have nowhere left to run.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36_INTRO_R,In many ways, the Alliance started on the Outer Rim.  Planets used being left alone by the Republic chafed under the rules of the Empire.  If the Alliance can gain control of the Rim, we surround the galaxy itself with a vision of freedom, an example to all who dwell closer to Coruscant and the heart of evil.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36_INTRO_U,The Outer Rim worlds hold much promise for the Zann Consortium.  They are isolated and far from the Empire's center at Coruscant, and as a result are more used to freedom and the temptations that only the Consortium can provide.  If we control the Rim, we complete a noose around the galaxy that we can then slowly constrict, choking the rest of the Empire.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_44,Galactic Conflict
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50,The Conflict Begins
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56,Equal Footing
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56_INTRO_E,During our battles with the Rebellion, we have noticed increased corruption and crime on many worlds.  The Emperor does not enjoy hearing that the funds meant for the advancement of his military are going to criminals, any more than he likes Rebel scum interfering with his rule.  Remove the Zann Consortium and the Rebellion from the galaxy by any means necessary.  Use your initial credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56_INTRO_R,Many worlds have been corrupted by the Zann Consortium, and still others have fallen to the iron hand of the Empire.  While I hate to divide our forces, something must be done.  Use your initial credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces and remove the Consortium and the Empire once and for all from the galaxy.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56_INTRO_U,Many worlds have been corrupted by the Zann Consortium, but the Empire and Rebellion are taking more notice of our cause and as a result, more of their forces are being devoted to eliminating the Consortium.  We are a much greater threat than ever before and as such, we will be seeing large scale attacks against Consortium-held worlds.  Use your initial credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces, and prepare for my total control of the galaxy.

TEXT_CONQUEST_ALIGN_KAINE_RETURNS,Grand Moff Kaine: I have returned. I managed to secure the cooperation of many companies and local sectors. This will be enough to secure out victory. The New Order has never fallen. Only the Emperor. The Emperor may be dead, but the Empire lives on!
TEXT_CONQUEST_BFC_DL_INTRO_ONE,Nil Spaar: I am Nil Spaar, and I am the Viceroy of the Duskhan League. It is time for us to achieve our destiny and wipe the filth from the galaxy. The New Republic will die. Beginning today, their lives depend on their being useful to us. The Yevetha are not civilized, Commander. It would be a mistake to deal with us as though we were.
TEXT_CONQUEST_BFC_NR_INTRO_ONE,Leia Solo: Our peace talks with the Duskhan League have fallen through, it's time for military action. I don't think there's any question but that Nil Spaar represents more worlds, a larger population, greater material riches, and a more advanced industrial-technological base than anyone who's come to Imperial City in the last twelve years. And he probably knows it, too.
TEXT_CONQUEST_BFC_SORANNONS_REVOLT,Sil Sorannan: This is Major Sil Sorannan of the Black Sword Command, Imperial Navy--acting captain of the Super Star Destroyer Intimidator and commodore of the Camp Pa'aal Squadron. For twelve years of torture, and too many friends, there isn't enough I can do to you, viceroy, I already know that killing you won't be satisfying. This is good-bye. We are taking back what is ours, starting with our freedom and these ships. We leave the New Republic to you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CARNOR_NR_INTRO_LEIA,Leia: The Emperor is dead, and the Imperials are fighting amongst themselves again, but we have a lot of work to do if we're going to recover from the last few years. It's like Endor all over again.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CARNOR_PA_INTRO_ONE,Moff: Although Kaine is dead, the Pentastar Alignment lives on. Our losses in the last few years are proof our initial position of striking out on our own was correct. The rebels are occupied with reclaiming the core, I suggest you work to secure our borders while we can.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CIS_COMMERCE_JOINS,Shu Mai: The final arrangements for Commerce Guild cooperation under the Confederacy Supreme Commander have been made. We are always eager to take advantage of shifting political realities.

TEXT_CONQUEST_CIS_TRADEFED_JOINS,Nute Gunray: Lord Sidious has insisted the Trade Federation organize ourselves entirely under the CIS structure.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E1,Commodore Grumby: We can no longer rely on the old agreements. Fragments of the Empire fight over our territory, hoping to steal our resources and profits, while all too many voices in the New Republic condemn our business practices. In order to preserve the Authority, the Board has authorized full mobilization of our forces. Our independence rests on your shoulders, Commander. Halt any move against it by whatever means necessary.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E2,Commodore Grumby: Zsinj's illegal seizure of our resources ends now! The time to rely on agreements made with the Old Republic has ended. From now on, we will enforce our independence with fleets rather than bureaucrats.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E3,Commodore Grumby: The Emperor may be back, but that doesn't mean a return to Imperial control. With less and less oversight and taxes, profits have soared, and the Direx Board is determined to keep things that way.
TEXT_CONQUEST_CSA_CSA_INTRO_E4,Commodore Grumby: The New Republic has been making overtures, but the Direx Board rejects their oversight. We don't need their ideals and taxes cutting into our returns, and they won't stomach enough war to force themselves upon us. It's time to show this new government we mean business.
TEXT_CONQUEST_DAALA_EOTH_INTRO_ONE,Voss Parck: Palpatine has, once again, been defeated. The New Republic has proven more tenacious than I could have imagined. I suggest we redouble our efforts, we must reunite the galaxy before the invaders arrive.
TEXT_CONQUEST_DAALA_IR_INTRO_ONE,Natasi Daala: I am Admiral Daala, the new leader of the Empire. I require your help to end this pitiful infighting between these so-called Imperials, and retake Coruscant for the Empire. I didn't want to rule. I had no intention of becoming a political leader—but they have given me no choice. I cannot leave the Empire in the hands of fools like Harrsk.
TEXT_CONQUEST_DAALA_NR_INTRO_ONE,Leia Solo: Hello, my name is Leia. We have beaten the Empire back to almost nothing, however Admiral Daala remains a threat, if she is able to reunite the Imperial forces. The New Republic is trusting you to eliminate her as a threat before she can expand her influence. Help us, you're our only hope.

TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_INTRO_E1,Grand Admiral Makati: Greetings, commander. It's good to see High Command finally sending those reinforcements. The Rebel presence grows stronger every day, the Corporate Sector is getting restless, and Zsinj is proving less trustworthy than I'd hoped. It's past time some order was restored to this corner of the galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_INTRO_E3,Emperor Palpatine: Root out these pathetic Rebels wherever they may be! The troublesome Alliance has fled to Mon Calamari and these Corporate fools think to defy me, but none can stand against the might of my Empire!
TEXT_CONQUEST_EMPIRE_CSA_PROPHETS,Grand Admiral Makati: Well, well, well. The exiled prophets, returned to the Imperial fold. If we weren't so short on personnel I'd take great pleasure in executing them, but they may prove to useful to the campaign. Keep a close watch on them commander, and don't trouble yourself too much if they die for the glory of the Empire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_CARNOR_INTRO,Sander Delvardus: The Emperor may have yet again been defeated, but construction of the Night Hammer is complete. We must establish ourselves as the dominant Imperial force in the core.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_DEEPCORE_INTRO,Sander Delvardus: New arrivals to the Core have put us in a dangerous position, but the Night Hammer is nearly complete. Soon, I shall sweep away all resistance!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_DEEPCORE_INTRO_E2,Sander Delvardus: I may have been pushed into these minor territories with petty fleets, but my hour will come! Clear away these contentious pretenders so that my reach may extend across the galaxy once more!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_DEEPCORE_NH,Sander Delvardus: At last! Years of labor in secret shipyards, tens of thousands of diverted credits, countless logistic sacrifices for the rest of the fleet... The Night Hammer is complete and my time has come! Forgive me, Seledra.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_WARLORDS_INTRO,Delvardus: Eriadu welcomes you. The noble families, including the Tarkins, have asked us to protect their holdings, however I have grander ideas. We will strike at the core and regain the glory of the former Empire for Eriadu. I trust you are up to the task.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_WARLORDS_KAINE,Delvardus: My old commander Ardus Kaine has been killed. This should leave the Pentastar Alignment in disarray.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ERIADU_WARLORDS_PESTAGE,Delvardus: Reports are saying that Sate Pestage has been killed or at least driven into hiding, and that Ysanne Isard is now in control of the Empire. this should mean the end of certain groups pretending to be loyal to Coruscant. We must proceed with caution.

TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_DAALA_CONTACT,Natasi Daala: This is Admiral Natasi Daala, of the Maw Research Facility. I am ashamed and disgusted to see what has become of the Empire in my absence. I had no intention of becoming a political leader—but you have given me no choice. I cannot leave the Empire in the hands of fools like you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_DAALA_ERA,Daala: The destruction of Imperial fleets by other Imperials must come to an end. We will stop the ridiculous infighting these warlords have perpetuated and the Empire will retake its rightful place in the galaxy.

TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PELLAEON_CONTACT,Daala: I believe the right person to lead the Empire forward is Gilad Pellaeon, though he may never admit it himself. With the Empire in Pellaeon's capable hands, I will continue my work in the core to bring the remaining warlords into line.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_PELLAEON_ERA,Pellaeon: Our numbers have dwindled in futile attempts to reclaim something that was taken from us long ago. The galaxy isn't ours by right; we have lost it. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can begin to understand what role exists for us now. It's time the Empire works its way towards our new future.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_THRAWN_CONTACT,Thrawn: This is Grand Admiral Thrawn. I am currently preparing to conclude my work in the Unknown Regions and return to the Empire, which I seem to notice has some need of my assistance since Endor. No doubt this will mean Isard will desert. If you should prefer my earlier return, I am prepared to assume command of the Imperial fleet as necessary.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_THRAWN_ERA,Thrawn: I have prepared the fleet, it's time to begin our reconquest of Rebel worlds and bring peace back to the galaxy to prepare for what's to come. Their military abilities are undeniable, but their chances for long-term stability are nonexistent.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_YSANNE_COUP,Ysanne Isard: If you have yet to hear of me, I am Ysanne Isard Director of Imperial Intelligence. I see you have pledged yourself to the service of Pestage. You know as well as I do that he is unsuitable to lead our Empire. I am planning his... removal, should you wish to assist. This can be done with or without you, but your assistance will certainly expedite the process. Pestage will be mine, and after him, the Empire of my master. Nothing will stop me.
TEXT_CONQUEST_EVENT_IR_YSANNE_ERA,Ysanne Isard: This is Director Isard. All Imperial forces are now under my control. My wish is the death of this Rebellion. Now with the Empire in my hands, there will be no one to stop me from making that wish come true.

TEXT_CONQUEST_HARRSK_DEEPCORE_NH,Blitzer Harrsk: Blast! Delvardus has constructed a super star destroyer. Where did he get the men to crew it?
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_IR_INTRO_BACTA,Isard: Our scientists have developed a virus which we have deployed on Coruscant to sow disorder and hostility among the Rebels. We need to take advantage of the situation and strike as soon as possible.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_IR_INTRO_ONE,Ysanne Isard: I am Director Isard, future Empress of a supreme Empire. The Rebels are continually harassing our borders, and the other pretenders to the Imperial throne have become greedy. They have truly bitten off more than they can chew and they will be choked to death because of it. The Empire will rise again and the natural order of things will again be established. I hope I am not mistaken in trusting you to maintain a certain level of competence.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_IR_INTRO_PSA,Ysanne Isard: Imperial Intelligence this area of the galaxy has a strong Rebel presence, and agents of Ardus Kaine have recently become more active. We cannot allow Kaine to secede from the Empire. I am occupied elsewhere but I am sure you are up to the challenge, commander. Make an example of him for those who would challenge our authority..
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_FIVE,The Vratix have successfully eradicated the Rylca! We can finally end the epidemic and focus on military efforts against the Empire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_FOUR,Good work, commander. Mirax has safely made it to Borleais with the Ryll Kor. Now all we need to do is produce the Rylca. We need to be quick, a lot of non-humans are beginning to think this is some sort of conspiracy, and Councillor Fey'lya's comments aren't helping.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_ONE,This is Wedge Antilles of Rogue Squadron. We've managed to secure Coruscant, commander, but the Empire appears to have unleashed some kind of virus targetting non-humans. We're trying to quarantine the problem but it's getting out of hand.  General Cracken is getting the Vratix established on Borleais to look into a cure.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_THREE,We've successfully secured the Ryll Kor with the cooperation of the Twi'leks. Send Mirax Terrick from Ryloth to Borleais so the Vratix can finish developing the treatment. Her father, Booster, can provide an escort with the Star Destroyer he captured, and the Twi'lek Tal'dira has joined us as well.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_BACTA_TWO,The Vratix have completed their research. They think they've discovered a cure, but we need some more supplies. You'll need to go to Ryloth and extract some Ryll Kor to bring back to the Vratix on Borleais.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_INTRO_MOTHMA,Mon Mothma: Our intelligence oepratives have confirmed that Ysanne Isard has taken command of the Imperial forces, and has removed the Executor's sister-ship, Lusankya, from Coruscant where it was hidden.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Hello, Commander. The New Republic is swiftly getting stronger, however our position is not entirely secured yet. Director Isard has taken command of the Empire, and Warlord Zsinj and Moff Kaine remain in powerful positions in the galaxy. Be careful in your planning and we may yet achieve peace.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_NR_INTRO_TSA,Mon Mothma: Ardus Kaine and the Pentastar Alignment have so far been peaceful towards us, but still ought to be careful. Director Isard and her forces appear to be active in the area as well. We must neutralize these threats or I fear peace may never return.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_PA_INTRO_ONE,Ardus Kaine: Greetings Commander. I am Grand Moff Ardus Kaine, leader of the Pentastar Alignment. Pretenders and Rebels alike dare to surround our borders. I am trusting you to secure the Alignment by annihilating all opposition. Do not allow this task to overwhelm you as our enemies are legion but the Alignment shall prevail. The New Order has never fallen, only the Emperor-now come with me and take this Galaxy in the name of the Pentastar Alignment. I do not suffer failure lightly.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_YONKA_DEFECTS,Wedge Antilles: Excellent work! Yonka has not only left Isard, but joined us with nearly the full crew of the Avarice!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_YONKA_DESERTS,Ysanne Isard: That worthless captain Sair Yonka has betrayed us! It seems he no longer has the stomach to what must be done to keep order, and may have even gone over to the Rebel scum! If we ever come across him or his family, he must pay for this treachery!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARD_YONKA_INTRO,Wedge Antilles: Our intelligence reports indicate that one of Isard's captains, Sair Yonka of the Star Destroyer Avarice, is growing disillusioned with her bloody policies. He makes regular visits to the Outer Rim near Ryloth, so we may have an opportunity to meet with him and convince him to desert her.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_IR_INTRO_ONE,Ysanne Isard: The Rebels mean to topple Delak Krennel’s petty hegemony, but they have been left weak by that fool Thrawn’s attacks. The scum think me dead, but with my help, Krennel will end this blight on the galaxy once and for all!
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_IR_LUSANKYA,Ysanne Isard: No! Word has just reached me that the Rebels have deployed a new vessel: my old flagship the Lusankya. They told the galaxy it had been scrapped, but now I must face down my own command.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_IR_ROGUES,Ysanne Isard: It seems we lost an entire fighter wing in the battle, but Rogue Squadron has been eliminated by my trap! A patrol nearly caught the Errant Venture snooping around the wreckage, but there can be little doubt: Wedge Antilles will no longer be a thorn in my side.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Thrawn's attacks hit us hard, commander. Before the remaining Imperials get any ideas, we need to show our strength. We've assembled an elite task force at Chandrila to liberate the Ciutric Hegemony from Delak Krennel's clutches.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_LUSANKYA,Mon Mothma: The unseen party watching the conflict is none other than Ysanne Isard. While we were engaged with Krennel, she has raided Bilbringi and taken Lusankya from the docks. Once again, we must contend with that madwoman at the helm of a super star destroyer.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_REQUIEM,Mon Mothma: Rogue Squadron proves difficult to kill. It seems that most of them were saved by some other group, but General Antilles has not seen fit to say who they were. Judging by the TIE Defenders they now fly, it was some Imperial group. We must be cautious going forward.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ISARDSREVENGE_NR_ROGUES,Mon Mothma: Tragedy strikes us, commander. Rogue Squadron was flying cover for a reconnaissance mission in Corvis Minor when they were ambushed. The only survivor was Wes Janson, currently in critical condition. We knew this campaign would cost us lives, but today we have lost heroes.
TEXT_CONQUEST_JAX_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: This is truly a day for celebration commander. Emperor Palpatine has been killed, hopefully for good this time. The Imperial forces are now under the command of Carnor Jax, however they are significantly depleted.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_PA_INTRO_FIVE,Ardus Kaine: Another leader has fallen before the might of the Alignment. The other groups who oppose our rightful position as the true Empire are crumbling as we speak, it is only a matter of time before the galaxy is under the firm control of the Alignment. Soon, order shall return to this ruined Galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_PA_INTRO_FOUR,Ardus Kaine: Daala believes she can reunite the Empire with herself at its head. This is a ridiculous notion, I've rarely seen a single person so incompetent. We are well on the way to our goal of galactic domination, Commander. Do not fail the Alignment now.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_PA_INTRO_ONE,Ardus Kaine: Greetings Commander. I am Grand Moff Ardus Kaine, leader of the Pentastar Alignment. Pretenders and Rebels alike dare to surround our borders. I am trusting you to secure the Alignment by annihilating all opposition. Do not allow this task to overwhelm you as our enemies are legion but the Alignment shall prevail. The New Order has never fallen, only the Emperor-now come with me and take this Galaxy in the name of the Pentastar Alignment. I do not suffer failure lightly.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_PA_INTRO_THREE,Ardus Kaine: Palpatine has returned. As before he has put his faith into overblown superweapons, and as before this shall be his downfall. Once again Palpatime will fall, and the galaxy will be ripe for the picking by the Alignment.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_PA_INTRO_TWO,Ardus Kaine: The pretender Isard has been removed from power, and replaced by Grand Admiral Thrawn. I advise caution in dealing with him.He may be a nonhuman, however he possesses great command ability. He shall not prevail against the new Empire we have built, it is the destiny of the galaxy to be ruled by the Alignment, whether they know it yet or not.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_TSA_INTRO_ONE,Grand Moff Ardus Kaine: Good day, Commander. I regret not having been able to greet you in person, however I am currently in the midst of negotiations aboard my flagship, Reaper, to bring the local sectors and companies into line. The talks are progressing well, however I will be unable to assist you until we are finished. I trust you will be able to contain our enemies until my return.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KAINE_YEVETHA_SPAWNS,Moff: A long-disappeared Imperial fleet has turned up under the command of the Yevetha in the Koornacht Cluster. We should act quickly to stop these vermin from infringing on Imperial territory with their stolen ships.
TEXT_CONQUEST_KATANA_FLEET_NAME,Dark Force Rising
TEXT_CONQUEST_MOFF_HAPES_SPAWNS,Moff: Our intelligence reports that the Hapans have left the seclusion of their star cluster and taken an interest in galactic politics.
TEXT_CONQUEST_OBJECTIVE_ECLIPSE_DESCRIPTION,The Eclipse is currently undergoing final construction at Byss. Survive until week 26 to gain use of Palpatine and his flagship.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_IR_INTRO,Pellaeon: It is time for Imperial leadership to face the reality of our situation. We have prepared a force using the captured Megador and Dominion for one final strike against the New Republic. Our goal here must be clear- we are not trying to reclaim a galaxy we have lost, we must simply ensure a stronger position from which to bargain for peace. Use my forces to lure them in, and then Rogriss will join us.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ORINDA_ROGRISS_JOINS,Pellaeon: Now that we have them engaged, it's time to strike with all available forces. [ Teren Rogriss has joined at Bastion ]
TEXT_CONQUEST_OVERVIEW_ART_OF_WAR,This is an era-progressive galactic conquest with various events that can unlock as you progress. Some planets you'll notice are flash rid or inaccessible, this means they are locked until certain events fire.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_BALMORRAN_CONQUEST,Imperial Trooper: The Balmorrans have been completely crushed. Several of their war machines have been confiscated as compensation for the trouble they've caused.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_BALMORRAN_REVOLT,Palpatine: The insolent Balmorrans have turned against us. Destroy any who stand in your path and seize their factories. Show them what it means to betray the Empire!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_BOUNCE_OSH,Palpatine: I am handling the preparations at Byss personally. They need not concern you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_DEVASTATOR_UNLOCK,Palpatine: The testing of our new superweapon has been successful. The World Devastators have been operating with great effect in the Borderland Regions. You will now begin deploying them in our main assault forces.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_EOTH_INTRO_ONE,Voss Parck: We have, unfortunately, received reports of the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn. However, he informed me before his departure that we may receive such news, and to await his return one decade later. In the meantime I suggest we continute our work. Good day. Be advised that there are currently rumours that Palpatine has returned. Unfounded, I'm sure, but be cautious all the same.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_IR_INTRO_DESCRIPTION,Emperor Palpatine has returned in a clone body, and spent the last few years gathering the loyalty of breakway Warlords with the intention of launching an assault on the New Republic to reclaim his Empire. As he makes preparations at Byss, you will lead the united Warlord forces into the galaxy.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_IR_INTRO_ONE,Palpatine: Despite the setbacks caused by the pathetic Warlords, everything is proceeding according to plan. I am making the final preparations at Byss for our assault on the Rebels. For now, you may direct the other Imperial forces to advance.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_IR_MUTINY,Palpatine: Those impatient fools have begun infighting while we make our preparations, weeding out the weak amongst them. 
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LEIA_PLEA,Leia Organa: Whatever Palpatine did to him, I don’t believe Luke has gone over to the Dark Side fully. If I could just talk with him, I know I could bring him back! If he can be captured, I'll have that chance.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LUKE_MISSION,Luke Skywalker: There's something wrong with the situation. I'm sensing a concentration of Dark Side energy in the Deep Core and must investigate. Hopefully I'll return with some answers
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LUKE_MISSION_D,Leia Organa: I’m not sure what that… rupture was that swallowed Luke up, but it didn’t kill him. I’ve just received a message from him, warning me to stay away from the Deep Core. Luke told me he felt a great disturbance in the Force before the battle. I've got a bad feeling about this...
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_LUKE_RETURNED,Luke Skywalker: I never meant to go so far. I had to pretend to join Palpatine or die, but I was going to sabotage his war effort from within. Thank the Force Leia was able to get through to me. When I face Palpatine again, I'll be ready.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_APPRENTICE,Palpatine: With Vader's betrayal, I require a new apprentice. One stronger than even Vader had the potential to be. You will bring me the son of Skywalker.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_APPRENTICE_DONE,Palpatine: You have done well. Young Skywalker has been converted to the Dark Side, and is ready to lead our forces into battle.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NEW_APPRENTICE_LOST,Palpatine: It seems young Skywalker has failed to truly embrace the power of the Dark Side and has gone back the pathetic Rebels. No matter! He shall be crushed with the rest of the scum once and for all!
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_DEVASTATORS,Mon Mothma: The Empire has unleashed another superweapon upon the galaxy, massive ‘World Devastators' that can devour both ships and planets.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO,Mon Mothma: There’s trouble brewing, Commander. Intelligence reports are incomplete, but it seems the warlords have put aside their differences and are gathering a powerful fleet to attack Corusant. We have already begun the evacuation, but I fear there are dark days ahead of us.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: The situation is worse than we could ever have feared, Commander. Emperor Palpatine has returned, and brought with him a fleet of powerful ships, including his flagshp, the Eclipse. At his side is the Jedi Luke Skywalker, dressed in the armor of Darth Vader.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PALPATINE_NR_INTRO_TWO,Mon Mothma: It seems that Emperor Palpatine has returned and brought with him a fleet of powerful ships, including his flagshp, the Eclipse. The situation is worse than we could ever have feared.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PELLAEON_EOTH_INTRO_ONE,Voss Parck: Hello again, commander. Our plans have been proceeding well, however it is time to redouble our efforts. Thrawn told us to watch for his return a decade after his departure, and that time is nearly upon us. We must unite the galaxy before the threats from beyond can catch us all off guard. We must succeed, we have no more options.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PELLAEON_IR_INTRO_ONE,Gilad Pellaeon: This is Grand Admiral Pellaeon. I have heard good things about you, Commander. Despite recent failures of Imperial leadership I'm sure you are up to the task at hand, however I urge you not to become overconfident; we are stretched too thin to risk any engagements we cannot win.
TEXT_CONQUEST_PELLAEON_NR_INTRO_ONE,Leia: We've almost liberated the entire galaxy, it's time to finish what we have started. Pellaeon has proven himself to be a capable and honourable man, however he still must be defeated if we hope to achieve peace.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E1,Admiral Ackbar: The Imperials and the Corporate Sector are at each other's throats. We may be able to weather out this storm to our advantage.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E3,Mon Mothma: Dark times are upon us. Any day now we expect a fleet to descend on Mon Calamari and threaten to extinguish what little flame of the Rebellion yet burns. Our only consolation is that the slavers and robber barons of the Corporate Sector seem determined to resist a return to Imperial control.
TEXT_CONQUEST_REBEL_CSA_INTRO_E4,Admiral Ackbar: The time has come to deal with the shamelss exploiters of the Corporate Sector. They have rejected every resolution condemning their immoral practices and every commission to expose their wrongdoing. The 'picket' fleets they're amassing makes it clear violence is the only argument they will consider.
TEXT_CONQUEST_SHADOWHAND_NR_CORUSCANT_BATTLE,We have to keep the Imperial fleet engaged while the evacuation is still ongoing. May the Force be with us.
TEXT_CONQUEST_SHADOWHAND_NR_CORUSCANT_BATTLE_RETREAT,Command has authorized withdrawal.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERADOC_CARNOR_INTRO,Treuten Teradoc: The Emperor is gone, but Maldrood lives. Kosh is attempting to hold our mid-rim territory, and I plan to take advantage of the disorganized forces in the core to establish our dominance.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERADOC_DEEPCORE_INTRO,Kosh Teradoc: Welcome, Commander. Borders have been stabilized in my brother's territory, and the time has come to turn our attention back to the Core. We may even be able to transfer some of Treuten's outdated pink ships here if we have need of them.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERADOC_DEEPCORE_NH,Treuten Teradoc: Intelligence reports sightings of a new super star destroyer. It would seem that the question of where all of Delvardus' resources have been going has been answered.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERADOC_HFZ_BREAKUP,Treuten Teradoc: It appears I was correct and the alliance has already begun to split. Zsinj's defeat has also meant an increased focus on ourselves as their primary enemy. We cannot allow them to gain any ground, so I have been forced to request the assistance of my brother Kosh and his forces.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERADOC_HFZ_INTRO,Treuten Teradoc: The traitor Rogriss and the Rebels appear to be making some form of alliance against Zsinj. We must act quickly and take advantage of the situation to expand our territory. If Zsinj is eliminated as a threat, that should also mean the end of the Rebel's alliance with Rogriss and the Ruling Council, turning the odds even more in our favour.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERADOC_WARLORDS_INTRO,Treuten Teradoc: So far we have been successful in establishing control over the Maldrood sector, and other surrounding sectors. We have to take this opportunity to gain the support of as many systems as we can. I have received a distress signal from Grand Admiral Pecatti Syn at Kashyyyk. If we move quickly, we can secure the system against the Rebellion and gain his loyalty.
TEXT_CONQUEST_TERRIK_VENTURE,Talon Karrde: Terrik wanted me to tell you that the Venture's too beat up to continue working for the Republic. He says that until you pay for the upgrades yourself, he's going to just go back to his old work. He also mentioned something about making it red. If you want him back, you'd better set one of your capital shipyards to fix up the Venture.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_CLONE_EMERGE,Thrawn: Surprised, Commander? I have returned. Not "returned" as such, of course. I am a clone of Grand Admiral Thrawn. I would have to be extremely arrogant to have assumed that even my rather extensive ability would have put my death out of the question. There is much to prepare, you may go.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_EOTH_INTRO_ONE,Thrawn: Greetings, Commander. I am Grand Admiral Thrawn, welcome to the Empire of the Hand. We are the last true hope the galaxy has for unity. It is unfortunate that we must fight other former Imperials, however it is necessary for the greater good. I look forward to your input.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_EOTH_INTRO_TWO,Voss Parck: I am Admiral Parck. Thrawn has asked me to debrief you on recent events. With the death of Director Isard, Thrawn has returned to the known galaxy to take control of the Empire. Unfortunately this puts us at odds with our leader, however Thrawn has instructed us to continue with our plans. We must not disappoint him.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_IR_INTRO_ONE,Thrawn: Greetings, Commander, I am Grand Admiral Thrawn, the new head of all Imperial forces. My predecessors have proven themselves less than capable, however I trust you will not show similar inadequacies. History is on the move, Commander. Those who cannot keep up will be left behind, to watch from a distance. And those who stand in our way will not watch at all.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_IR_KATANA_BATTLE,Thrawn: So here it is, the elusive Katana Fleet. I admit I did not believe I would ever lay eyes on such a welcome sight. We must move our shuttles to capture as many dreadnaughts as possible before the Rebels are destroyed.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_IR_KATANA_INFO,Thrawn: In our recent efforts to capture Pantolomin, we came accross one Hoffner who, according to Niles Ferrier, used to work with Jorj Car'das and Talon Karrde. He has given us the location of what he believes to be the Katana Fleet, at that location I have marked as Deep Space on your NavComp. Send a fleet led by myself to that location and we'll see if we can't use that fleet to our advantage, Commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NKLLON_CONCLUSION,Thrawn: Exemplary work. Fifty-one mole miners to be converted to boarding craft. Monitor our intelligence channels for likely targets.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NKLLON_INTRO,Thrawn: With Wayland’s technology, we now face a shortage of ships rather than crews. To that end, we should secure material to capture vessels from our foes. Nkllon in the Athega system will have a good quantity of mining equipment to repurpose.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NR_INTRO_ONE,Mon Mothma: Greetings, Commander. I am Mon Mothma, Chief of State of the New Republic. The Senate has appointed you as the head of our armed forces in the fight against Grand Admiral Thrawn. We have very little knowledge about him, however recent reports have indicated he is a superb strategist. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. May the Force be with you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NR_KARRDE_BATTLE,Talon Karrde: Well, here it is, the Katana Fleet. Looks like we've got some company though, so we'll have to take care of the Imperials before we can do anything with them. Try to move your transports next to the dreadnaughts and capture as many as possible.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_NR_KARRDE_INFO,Talon Karrde: Hey kid, the name's Talon Karrde. I've got some information on some frigates. Normally I wouldn't stick my head into galactic affairs like this, but let's just say I have my reasons for cooperating with you, for now. If you're interested, send a fleet with me to the that location in deep space.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_OBROA_CONCLUSION,Thrawn: Excellent work! The library indeed contains the location of Wayland, the Emperor's technological storehouse. There I expect to find the key to the only puzzle worth solving. The complete, total, and utter destruction of the Rebellion.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_OBROA_INTRO,Thrawn: Your first order is to secure the information library at Obroa-skai, commander. It may well hold the next piece of information key to my plans, which I've spent most of a year searching for.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_PANTOLOMIN_INTRO,Thrawn: Ferrier has found an intriguing lead on some derelicts. Secure Pantolomin so that we may follow these whispers where they might lead.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_RUMORS,Voss Parck: Ten years have passed since news of Thrawn's death, just when he said he'd be returning. Reports from Agent Sorn indicate that he may be working with the Empire again, and whispers abound that he's back. It's time we find the source of these rumors and see if Thrawn truly has revealed himself.
TEXT_CONQUEST_THRAWN_TAKE_WAYLAND,Thrawn: Wayland has exceeeded out hopes. It not only contains cloning devices that can be used to bolster our dwindling forces, but I have also secured the aid of the Dark Jedi guardian of Mount Tantiss.
TEXT_CONQUEST_WARLORDS_IR_INTRO_PESTAGE,Sate Pestage: The Rebels have been making inroads on our territory, and some of the our own commanders have decided to abandon their duties, though they claim otherwise. I leave it to you to reunite my Empire. The Warlord filth are no different from the Rebels. Ensure the Empire is victorious on all fronts.
TEXT_CONQUEST_WARLORDS_NR_INTRO_ACKBAR,Ackbar: Since Daala's retirement the Empire has seemed inactive, but be alert- informants within the Empire have suggested they are planning some sort of ambush. Wedge Antilles and Areta Bell will handle that area, for now.
TEXT_CONQUEST_WARLORDS_NR_INTRO_MOTHMA,Mon Mothma: The Emperor may be defeated, but our work is far from over. Many systems still remain under Imperial oppressors. Fortunately, the Imperials have begun infighting. We must take advantage of this opportunity. I recommend you begin by relieving our Sullustan allies, who have been surrounded by the forces of Sander Delvardus.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_BACTA_INTRO_ONE,Zsinj: It appears that after the blasted Rebels took Coruscant they started shifting their attention to us. We'll have to act fast to build our defenses and push for the core ourselves.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_CSA_INTRO_E1,Warlord Zsinj: More urgent matters on my other borders take my attention, but I have full confidence in your ability to handle this theater, commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_HFZ_BREAKUP_NR,Han Solo: Great work kid, we've taken out Zsinj. Don't get too comfortable though, the Imperials have called off the truce and look like they're about ready to start fighting again.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_HFZ_DEATH,Moff: Unfortunately sir, the death of our leader has sent our forces into disarray. The Corporate Sector has used the confusion to throw off our control. However, the Rebels and Ruling Council have once again begun fighting and ended their own alliance, so hope is not lost.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_HFZ_INTRO,Warlord Zsinj: I require your assistance. The Rebel General Han Solo and the ruling council have decided to align against us, while that blasted earworm Teradoc and his forces are looking to scavenge from the remains. This cannot be allowed to happen. We kill General Han Solo and as many of his friends and aides as is Humanly possible. I leave it to you, commander.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_HAPES_ONE,Leia Organa: You must be the one Han's been talking about. I believe I may be able to get us new allies in our fight against the Empire. Send me to the Transitory Mists and I should be able to convince the Hapes Consortium to join our fight. I need to go alone, or the Hapans may take it as a declaration of war.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_HAPES_THREE,Leia Organa: I've returned, commander. I was able to convince the Hapans to join us. Prince Isolder and his fleet should now be under your command. May the force be with you.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_HAPES_TWO,Leia Organa: I am in contact with the Hapan government. I'll return to Coruscant when I've spoken to the royal family.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_NR_INTRO_ONE,Han Solo: Is this thing on? This is General Solo, I'm in charge of the force going after that hawk-bat Zsinj. We've made a truce with the Imperials for now, so they won't attack us as long as we don't attack them.
TEXT_CONQUEST_ZSINJ_WARLORDS_INTRO,Warlord Zsinj: The Emperor's death has finally provided me with an opportunity to prove myself as the real power in this galaxy. Already, many systems have flocked to our control. That impertinentTeradoc has run off with my Crimson Command fleet however, so we should first direct our forces to exterminate him.

TEXT_LORE_IMPERIAL_MUTINY,Lore Holocron: Imperial Mutiny
TEXT_LORE_IMPERIAL_MUTINY_DESCRIPTION,In the years leading up to Shadow Hand, Imperial forces from all over the galaxy began to disappear without a trace, having been called to Palpatine's side as he was preparing his assault from the deep core. While the initial attacks by these forces in 10 ABY were successful, they soon began infighting, a process which Palpatine believed would weed out the weak. Among the casualties from what would be called the Imperial Mutiny were multiple of the Super Star Destroyers which had disappeared to and set out from the Deep Core- Whelm (Executor-class) and Panthac (Mandator III-class) which destroyed each other at Alsakan, Javelin (Vengeance-class) which rammed a torpedo sphere defending Chasin, and the Aculeus (Mandator III-class), which was destroyed by TIE Droid squadrons over Drearia.
TEXT_LORE_LIINADE_CONQUEST,Conquest of Liinade III
TEXT_LORE_LIINADE_CONQUEST_DESCRIPTION,The battle at Liinade III became a focus of propaganda for both sides after plans for a Death Star-like superweapon were found in its aftermath. These plans rapidly replaced the murder of Sate Pestage as the reason to bring Delak Krennel to justice. For his part, the Prince-Admiral claimed that the plans were planted and that he would never develop such a horrible device. Krennel had been talking with the survivors of Alderaan regarding the establishment of a haven for them, and he sorrowfully announced to the galaxy that he had had Liinade III in mind as its location. In reality, the plans were a counterfeit of the real Ysanne Isard, who used the subsequent investigation to her advantage.
TEXT_LORE_REQUIEM_SQUADRON,Requiem Squadron
TEXT_LORE_REQUIEM_SQUADRON_DESCRIPTION,In the ambush at Distna, a moon of Corvis Minor V, Rogue Squadron was nearly destroyed by a wing of TIE fighters. But two squadrons of TIE Defenders intervened and took the surviving Rogues to the base of a secretive Imperial organization. This group sent the Rogues to Ciutric in a TIE Defender squadron, posing as Requiem Squadron led by one of Wedge Antilles' old aliases, Antar Roat. A message dispatched to the New Republic High Command detailed the timetable of their sabotage mission.

TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_01,We received word from some reliable sources.  Our spies have alerted us that the bounty hunter Boba Fett has been seen entering orbit above a nearby Empire-controlled planet.  He is responsible for the death and torture of many of our allies.  We need you to take a fleet and dispatch this threat.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_02,You have done the Alliance a great service.  We have word that Boba Fett was able to escape somehow.  He's in hiding currently, but he may make a return.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_TITLE,Confront Boba Fett
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONQUER_00,If we don't gain more ground, our cause is finished.  Deploy some troops and help free another planet to join the Alliance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONQUER_01,Your actions have not gone unnoticed.  Volunteers to our cause present themselves daily, and many ask to be assigned to you.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_00,There are some troubling developments to discuss.  We are receiving early reports of massing Imperial fleets and signs are pointing to a significant attack in the near future.  Our intelligence has revealed the probable target and I trust you to defend the embattled system.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_01,The Empire has made its move and their ships will be exiting hyperspace shortly.  They believe this to be a surprise attack; let us hope that your preparations have been sufficient to turn that surprise around.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_02,A heroic victory!  The Empire will surely think twice before attempting to surprise us again.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_03,Clearly our intelligence sources underestimated the scale of that assault.  We must regroup and fight on. The Imperial blockade cannot be allowed to remain.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CREDIT_WINDFALL_00,Thank you.  We have found ourselves with a surplus of credits, and it's only right that you should dictate how they are spent.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CREDITS_00,Our financial experts are predicting a shortage of credits soon.  We need to stockpile our finances to weather the crisis to come.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CREDITS_01,I am grateful for your assistance.  While you were away our scientists researched some new technology you may appreciate.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_01,We are receiving reports from pirate spies that the Empire has left one of their systems undefended.  This is an excellent opportunity to free innocent civilians from the oppression of the Imperial army.  Be advised that this information comes to us from questionable sources.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_02,The pirate intelligence proved to be a great benefit to our cause.  Be advised that the pirates serve only themselves.  Future pirate reports should be followed with caution.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_03,We have discovered that the information given to us by the pirates was false.  In addition they have betrayed us and are planning an attack against our cause.  Muster what forces you have and defend against this treachery.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_04,It was wise of you to realize the trap set by the pirates.  Let this be a lesson that not all information can be taken at face value.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_05,You have proven that you can master any situation, commander. You will receive a credit bonus for your performance under pressure.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_06,Not all battles end in victory.  Learn from your mistakes.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_TITLE,Pirate Enlightenment
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_01,An Alliance fleet was recently ambushed and captured.  We have recently learned that the fleet is being held at a secret location on an Empire-controlled planet.  We need you to capture this planet for the Alliance.  Not only will you be liberating a world from the Empire, but you will be adding new members to our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_02,Your actions have not gone unnoticed.  Volunteers to our cause present themselves daily, and many ask to be assigned to you.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_00,The Empire has suppressed the Rebellion for the last time.  You must pay for the damage and destruction you have caused throughout the galaxy.  I will see that the debt you owe the Rebellion is paid.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_01,The Rebellion will never fall to the Empire.  You have destroyed Home One, but we will rebuild.  When the time is right, we will return.  You will eventually pay for your crimes against the innocent.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_02,Many brave individuals perished today.  They are heroes and will be remembered as such.  Our fleet is still intact and will continue to fight against the evil Empire.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_03,Your help is in great need, commander.  An Imperial fleet is rampaging through allied systems.  We must regroup and neutralize this evil before any more innocents are murdered.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_TITLE,Fleet Rescue
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_00,We have received many reports from our spies concerning the Empire.  Apparently, many of the Empire's most influential persons are gathered on one planet.  This is our chance.  Take a fleet and dispatch the Empire’s leaders.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_01,A great opportunity has passed us by.  Word comes to me that the Empire’s leaders have gone their separate ways.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_02,Well done, commander!  Our targets have managed to escape death somehow, but they will not be able to command while they recover from your strike.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_00,Reports are coming in that several Imperial capital ships have been spotted in orbit above a planet controlled by the Empire.  We cannot allow the Empire to build large fleets unchallenged.  I need you to confront this fleet and destroy at least 3 of these ships.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_01,The Alliance is in your debt commander.  You have struck a great blow against the Imperial army today.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_00,Word comes to us that the inhabitants of one of the Empire's systems are revolting against their Imperial oppressors.  They will not last long against the heartless destruction of the Empire.  Act quickly, commander, as time is of the essence.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_01,We’ve received a distress call from a planet revolting against the Empire.  More and more innocents die every second we do not help them.  The entire populace will soon be wiped out if we do not respond.  Make haste commander.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_02,This is a sad day, commander.  Word comes to us that the revolt against the Empire has surrendered.  Their losses were too great to continue to fight.  It’s a shame we were unable to help them in their time of need.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_03,We have been contacted by the leader of the revolt.  The entire populace of the planet is forever indebted to us.  If ever the Empire strikes at their planet again, they will rise to help us.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_TITLE,Indigenous Revolt
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_01,We have received a distress call that cannot be ignored.  The Empire has conquered yet another planet and the people are suffering greatly.  If we help, they have promised us that a local smuggler and bounty hunter will do our bidding in the future.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_02,Your actions prove your true loyalty to the Alliance and the galaxy.  There are many here who wish to serve under your command.  A smuggler and a bounty hunter have been reassigned to your command.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_TITLE,Empire Oppression
TEXT_MON_EVENT_PLANET_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_00,One of our allied planets has betrayed us.  It has come to our attention that the system’s leaders have been cooperating with the Empire for some time now.  The system is a great loss to the Alliance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_PLANET_WINDFALL_00,Our influences have reached one of the Empire's planets.  They have decided to revolt and join our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_01,A band of underground Alliance supporters have been discovered by the Empire.  They are being hunted and need help fleeing to safety.  They have requested that we escort them to a friendly system.  Among the supporters is a wealthy dignitary who will reward you handsomely.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_02,The consular thanks you for the great service you have performed for him.  As a reward for your efforts he has decided to reward you generously.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_03,That did not turn out as we had hoped.  Perhaps you were not ready for the responsibility.  Unfortunately the refugees have perished and we will receive no reward.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_DESTINATION,Escort Refugees To: %s
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_LOCATION,Refugees Location: %s
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_TITLE,Refugee Escort
TEXT_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_01,The Black Sun pirates have requested our assistance.  One of their leaders has been captured and is being tortured by the Empire.  The pirates have come to us because they are unable to covertly rescue him.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_02,The pirates have managed to find their leader being held on the surface of that planet.  They have held true to their promise and are delivering a Venator-class cruiser to us in thanks.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_TITLE,Pirate Rescue
TEXT_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_00,Some of the Imperial fleets have been moving to areas of space with no strategic value that we can see.  I think an investigation is warranted, but sending an entire fleet would attract too much attention.  Take a stealth unit and explore this planet.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_01,Your investigations have proved most fruitful.  The information you've gathered reveal that forces are marshalling for an attack in another part of the galaxy.  Send a scout unit to investigate further.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_02,Your actions have strengthened the Alliance.  Many of the more wealthy citizens of the galaxy have responded with covert donations.  Use them well.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_01,In some cases, a show of strength is more effective than diplomacy.  Citizens from an Empire-controlled planet are weary of the Imperial presence throughout galaxy.  They have shown interest in joining the Alliance, but first they require a demonstration of our strength.  If we can defeat the Empire or the pirates in a land battle, they will join our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_02,With our last victory, we have gained favor with citizens throughout the galaxy.  In fact, a revolt has taken place on an Empire-controlled controlled planet.  This system has sworn allegiance to us in our future endeavors.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_TITLE,Show of Strength
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRUCTURE_00,The Alliance needs every credit it can get.  Unfortunately, it does us no good if we don’t use it to both protect ourselves and bring the fight to the Empire.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRUCTURE_01,I am in your debt.  Your actions have attracted a bit of a following - Volunteers have appeared asking to be assigned to your command.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,You have done well.  We have some new tech available for you - It should help us in the struggle.  Your tech level has been raised one level.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TRAP_00,Recent Imperial troop movements have created an opportunity to strike and liberate another world.  I would advise you to plan an assault, but use caution - a trap is always a possibility.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TRAP_01,It seems as though the opportunity has passed and Imperial defenses are once again in place.  I have confidence that you made the right decision in refusing to be baited, but remember that an excessively defensive strategy allows the Empire to continue to expand their dominance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TRAP_02,It's a trap!  Bolster your defenses to survive the battle.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,I am grateful for your presence, commander.  We have reallocated some units to your service.  I'm sure you will put them to good use.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNITS_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the Empire - Fleets, ground troops and secondary structures all play a part in defense.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have done well in building our forces.  I have decided to allocate more funding to you.  Use these credits wisely.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,You are doing well, but our defenses need to be even stronger.  Upgrade one of our star bases to strengthen our defenses.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,Your actions have strengthened our position in the galaxy. Word of your actions has spread and donations continue to flow in.  Use these credits wisely.

TEXT_PLANET_AARGAU_INFO_HIS_01,Aargau was a member of the Galactic Republic from its discovery until the end of that galactic power. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, it was considered a New Republic stronghold. The region of space occupied by the planet would later fall under the hegemony of first the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and then subsequently Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. Despite this, Aargau took a neutral approach to politics, which meant that warring factions were mutually welcome to conduct business on the planet. The planetary government imposed only three laws on citizens and visitors, called the Three Statutes of Aargau. These laws focused on the export of Aargau's natural resources, the absolute ban on weapons for visitors—and, conversely, the requirement to bear arms for Aargauuns—as well as maintaining the integrity of the Bank of Aargau. Breaking any of these rules was punishable by immediate execution.

TEXT_PLANET_AETENII_INFO_HIS,A planet located in the Outer Rim. Plagued by volcanic activity, Aeten II is known for its deposits of rare stygium crystals, which are used in the construction of cloaking devices. Because stygium crystals are extremely valuable, a number of unscrupulous prospectors descended upon Aeten II, where they competed for the rare crystals with deadly abandon. As a result, Aeten II became one of the most dangerous planets in the Outer Rim territories. By the rise of the Empire, Aeten II's cache of crystals had been all but depleted, making the manufacture of new stygium-based cloaking devices a near impossibility. Prospectors looking to retool old mining facilities here have since found other valuable resources to mine.

The horrors of the Clone Wars were taken to heart and the people of Alderaan adopted pacifism banning all weapons from the planet’s surface. However the rise of the Emperor has caused a growing opposition to Imperial rule and increased support for the Rebellion.

TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_13,This is a bad idea.
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_14,What have I got to lose?
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_15,This is suicide.
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_2,I don't think this is a good idea.
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_3,I think I'd do better on the ground
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_4,Attack that?
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_5,You're kidding, right?
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_6,Uh...attack…ok.
TEXT_SFX_UDI_ATTACK_7,Waste of good cargo if you ask me.

TEXT_SPEECH_ABREGADORAE_BRB_VICTORY_COR01_01,Defiler: I've bribed the spaceport commissioner, to stop the flow of garrison units from Abregado-rae to our enemies. I've also acquired records of ship movements along the Remma trade route.
TEXT_SPEECH_ACT01_M04_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: I want to deal with Jabba myself - the battle will not begin without me.
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_LOAD_COR02_01,Bossk: Anyone not doing their part, I'll kill personally, begin the battle. 
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_LOSS_COR02_04,Bossk: The forces you sent me to do the battle were totally untrained and useless. I've killed the survivors and am coming back to train new forces myself. I'll not be stopped!
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_TACTICAL_COR02_02,Bossk: The Stygium Crystal storage containers will be well guarded. Destroying 5 containers and nearby enemy ships will help to secure our hold on the Aeten II system. 
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_VICTORY_COR02_03,Bossk: The Stygium Crystal capsules and enemy targets have been eliminated. I expect my fee to be doubled for my success.
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_RKT_VICTORY_COR02_05,Defiler: The miners of Aeten II are exhausting their credit accounts in our cantinas. We're even starting to get Stygium Crystals as payments for their debts. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_BLK_VICTORY_COR03_05,Defiler: We've successfully set up a Black Market on Alzoc III. Already new ships of surprising power are being made available to Consortium forces. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_LOAD_COR03_01,Tyber Zann: Now that I've come all the way down here we clearly have to kill some of those Shaaks, let's say ten heads. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_LOSS_COR03_04,Tyber Zann: The Alzoc III forces put up a surprising fight. I'm going to have to acquire more battle units before I try taking this planet again. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_TACTICAL_COR03_02,Tyber Zann: I'm taking a few associates down to the planet to rough up the food Commissioner. Once we have him under our thumb I'll control the output of the entire planet
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_VICTORY_COR03_03,Tyber Zann: The Commissioner is now under our control. We'll start by limiting the miners food supply until they dramatically increase their production. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_LOAD_COR04_01,Bossk: Move your lazy hides. I want this mission over quickly. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_LOSS_COR04_04,Bossk: There were hidden reserves of troops on planet. We'll have to go in much better prepared if we attack in the near future. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_TACTICAL_COR04_02,Bossk: Fleet commander Flankar from Anaxes has a galaxy-wide reputation as being the best. Once we have demonstrated our power,  he will be more easily controlled by the Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_VICTORY_COR04_03,Bossk: The entire Perlemian Trade Route is in our control. We'll now be able to put a stranglehold on half the free trade of the galaxy. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_RKT_VICTORY_COR04_05,Defiler: Our organization has targeted the merchant crews coming to the planet for entertainment. I expect this operation will be very lucrative.
TEXT_SPEECH_ATZERRI_BRB_VICTORY_COR05_02,Defiler: Bribery on Atzerri has exceeded our wildest expectations. The planet is completely corrupt and massive credit deposits are coming our way. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ATZERRI_RKT_VICTORY_COR05_01,Defiler: Our Racketeering efforts were extremely successful on the criminally corrupt world of Atzerri. Crime bosses almost stood in line to get a piece of our operations there.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_LOAD_COR06_01,Tyber Zann: We'll advance into the system and destroy the next Tibanna gas shipment. That should make it easier for us to gain credits for our own fleet buildups. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_LOSS_COR06_04,Tyber Zann: The death squadrons guarding the Tibanna gas shipments proved stronger than we expected. We'll have to go back and gather more forces if we are to corrupt this system. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_02,Tyber Zann: I have no intention of staying here long. Destroy our enemies ships and prepare for the next battle. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_06,Tyber Zann: We've managed to bribe and capture an Imperial Interdictor.  We will be using the Interdictor to pull Tibanna gas convoys out of Hyperspace.  For this plan to work, the Interdictor will need to activate its ability near the Bespin shipping lanes.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_07,Tyber Zann: The first convoy should be arriving any time now.  We'll need to destroy the Tibanna shuttles before they escape the range of the Interdictor.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_08,Tibanna Merchant: It's an ambush!  Take evasive action.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_09,Tyber Zann: Destroying another convoy should be sufficient to put some fear into Bespin's government.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_10,Tibanna Merchant: Pirates!  All hands defend the Tibanna shuttle!
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_11,Tyber Zann: Good work.  Bespin is now under the protection of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_VICTORY_COR06_03,Tyber Zann: Tibanna shipments to our enemies will now slow down to a crawl. We should gain enough credits to begin a rapid build up of Zann Consortium space fleets. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_RKT_VICTORY_COR06_05,Defiler: Corruption has taken hold of the  Cloud City populace.  The few other worthwhile targets there will soon be under our control as well.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_BLK_VICTORY_COR07_05,Defiler: Bestine’s many technological facilities now regularly release their products to our black market; the steady traffic insures that the Consortium is never short on credits or new weapons.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_LOAD_COR07_01,IG-88: Our plans are set with an 87% chance of success. Begin the mission. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_LOSS_COR07_04,IG-88: I clearly need more forces for this difficult target. Mass more units and we will strike again. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_TACTICAL_COR07_02,IG-88: The commander Ral Falan is the most powerful man on the planet. Taking him hostage and acquiring his plans and secrets could have galaxy wide effects. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_VICTORY_COR07_03,IG-88: Torture droids are penetrating the brain of our hostage. Soon we will know his plans and be able to use that information accordingly.
TEXT_SPEECH_BONADAN_CRM_VICTORY_COR08_02,Defiler: Special Bonadan military units have joined the us and will revolt against enemy leaders who try and put an end our corruption on the planet. Power to the Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_BONADAN_RKT_VICTORY_COR08_01,Defiler: We've set up operations at the Southeast Bonadan Spaceport and from there we are quickly spreading our organization throughout the world. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_BND_VICTORY_COR09_05,Defiler: Slavers on Bothawui have generously offered the Consortium use of their armed forces. You may begin sending these death squads on Zann Consortium missions. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_INT_LOAD_COR09_01,Tyber Zann: What, you want to live forever? Get down on the world and destroy things. 
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_INT_LOSS_COR09_04,Tyber Zann: My plans were thwarted on Bothawui, I didn't anticipate such high security. I'll try again with more forces
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_INT_OBJECTIVE_01,Rough up Senator Se'lab.
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_INT_OBJECTIVE_02,Destroy Senator Se'lab's Palace to flush the Senator out.
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_INT_TACTICAL_COR09_02,Tyber Zann: By using intimidation on the good senator, I gain major political influence to further my goals.
TEXT_SPEECH_BOTHAWUI_INT_VICTORY_COR09_03,Tyber Zann: Senator Polo Se'lab has been successfully intimidated. Bothawui will now vote our way. My plans are proceeding better than I expected.
TEXT_SPEECH_BYSS_BLK_VICTORY_COR10_05,Defiler: Now that we've placed a black market on a major Imperial planet, we'll soon have access to their technologies.
TEXT_SPEECH_BYSS_KID_LOAD_COR10_01,Silri: Stay close and I'll shield you from most of the dangers of the Force. Beware, the enemy presence is strong here.
TEXT_SPEECH_BYSS_KID_LOSS_COR10_04,Silri: The data we took before will give us an advantage when we return to this world.
TEXT_SPEECH_BYSS_KID_TACTICAL_COR10_02,Silri: Because I'm attuned to the dark side I may be the only one who has any chance of success here. Follow my lead if you wish to live.
TEXT_SPEECH_BYSS_KID_VICTORY_COR10_03,Silri: Now that I've corrupted one of the most powerful worlds in the Galaxy. Word will soon reach the Emperor.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_,[TBL]
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10A_INTRO_E,Imperial defenses are failing throughout the galaxy; only three planets still belong to the Empire, and they are weak and undefended.  If the Empire is to survive, you must push back the Rebel offensive.  You will be granted 5,000 initial credits for the strengthening of your forces.  Beware of outlying Pirate-controlled worlds who stand in your way.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10A_INTRO_R,Only a small group of systems remain under Imperial control, and war has taken its toll on the galaxy.  As a result, both sides must build from the ground up to advance.  Use the 5,000 starting credits to remove the remains of the Empire from the galaxy.  Beware of outlying pirate-controlled systems in the galaxy that hold no ties with either side.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10B_INTRO_E,Research has been completed on the Death Star project.  Use the provided 8,000 credits to construct the battle station as soon as possible.  Be sure to build additional forces to compliment the Death Star on its maiden voyage.  Upon completion, you are to eliminate the Rebel threat from the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10B_INTRO_R,The Empire is constructing a massive, mobile superweapon platform that is capable of destroying entire planets.  You will have 8,000 credits at your disposal.  Your mission is to destroy the Death Star at any cost.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15_INTRO_E,The Empire has already completed the construction of several Star Destroyers at the Kuat Drive Yards.  The Rebellion has upgraded their starbases in preparation for the upcoming battles.  You have 15,000 credits at your disposal; use this to utterly destroy the Rebellion.  You must complete this task within 20 days, or they will scatter to the ends of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15_INTRO_R,Reports have surfaced that the Empire is dedicating most of their production to building Star Destroyers at the Kuat shipyards.  The Empire cannot be allowed to gain a production advantage in space.  Use this 8,000 credits allocated to aid you in taking control of Fondor, Fresia and Kuat.  You must hurry; if you cannot complete your task in 20 days, all will be lost.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20_INTRO_E,The Empire's foothold in the galaxy has been compromised.  Pirates have run rampant across many systems.  Use your initial 3,000 credits to secure control of both the Pirate and Rebel-controlled planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20_INTRO_R,The Empire is weak from corruption; most of their systems have been overrun with pirates.  You must lead the Alliance forces into battle against the Pirates and the remains of the Empire. You will begin with 4,000 credits; use it liberate the remaining planets in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25_INTRO_E,This Rebellion has subverted many of the outlying systems of the galaxy and the Empire is in dire peril of losing Coruscant.  Imperial forces have pulled back and fortified the Core Worlds, but it is only a matter of time before the Rebels begin their assault.  A sum total of 9,000 credits has been made available to you.  Rebuild the Imperial Navy, destroy the Rebels, and protect the Emperor at all costs.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25_INTRO_R,The Alliance controls most of the outlying worlds of the galaxy. Now is the time to strike at the heart of the Empire: Emperor Palpatine must be removed from power, and Coruscant must be controlled.  You have been granted 15,000 credits to prepare for this assault.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30_INTRO_E,Imperial forces have managed to flee to the fringes of the galaxy.  Due to the strain of war and mismanagement by corrupt Imperial officials, you have only 5,000 credits left to retake the Core Worlds and the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30_INTRO_R,The Alliance has managed to push the Empire from the Core Worlds, but several outlying worlds remain under their control.  Only 5,000 credits are available for military funding.  Recapturing some of the pirate controlled worlds will help with our income.  Remember that the ultimate goal is to vanquish the last bastions of the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35_INTRO_E,The Empire has underestimated the resourcefulness of the Rebellion.  While we were fighting battles on the outer rim, several Core worlds have fallen to Rebel attacks.  As a result, Imperial forces have been fractured.  The Rebel presence persists in every corner of the galaxy.  You have 6,000 credits to use for the reconstruction of Imperial forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35_INTRO_R,War is raging throughout the galaxy.  There have been several battles with the Empire and the Alliance is now spread very thin across the galaxy.  Many Rebel worlds are cut off from each other.  An attack can come at any time at any location.  Act quickly and use your initial 6,000 credits to defend your foothold in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_44_INTRO_E,A Rebel uprising has taken place on many of the Outer Rim worlds.  The 10,000 credits at your disposal should be used to destroy all traces of the Rebellion and reestablish control of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_44_INTRO_R,Many worlds have sworn allegiance to the Alliance, but the Empire sees the Rebellion as a much greater threat than ever before and as such will be directing large scale attacks against Alliance-held worlds.  Use your initial 10,000 credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50_INTRO_E,Coruscant is the center of Empire, both literally and figuratively.  While the outlying systems claim fealty, the Emperor wishes to take a more active role in their control.  Use these 8,000 credits to take the might of the Empire wherever you can.  You may run across small pockets of a newly-formed Rebellion - crush them whenever possible.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50_INTRO_R,The Alliance is small, holding only one planet as a base of operations.  The Empire has consolidated their presence in the center of the galaxy.  Both sides hold little advantage.  The Rebels must use every conceivable means to bring the galaxy back together under a banner of freedom.  You have 8,000 credits to bolster your forces, but survival depends on spreading the Rebellion to new planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_60_INTRO_E,Imperial forces have managed to push back the Rebellion in certain areas, but this sector remains stubborn.  Neither side has any real advantage.  Use the 20,000 credits provided to remove the Rebel forces in the area so that the Empire can concentrate on more important concerns.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_60_INTRO_R,The Rebellion and Empire have divided this area of the galaxy evenly, neither with any apparent advantage over the other.  You must use the 20,000 credits provided to liberate all of these worlds and bring freedom to the sector.

TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_FOUR_25,Darth Vader: Captain, what information have you extracted from the pirate?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_FOUR_26,Imperial Officer: The Rebels are planning some sort of ambush.  He did not know the traitor's identity.

TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_02,Stormtrooper: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_03,Imperial Officer: The probe droid has pinpointed what we believe to be the pirate base.  It is in a dense asteroid field, with a heavy, layered defense.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_04,Darth Vader: These pirates have knowledge of the Rebel’s plans.    We must capture their leader - no disintegration, Fett!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_05,Boba Fett: Leave the defenses to me.  Keep the other ships back until I signal.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_06,Boba Fett: Sensor satellites are deployed all over the perimeter.  This shouldn't take long.

TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_12,Boba Fett: I’ve got to take out that satellite before it triggers an alert.

TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_18,Tarkin: While you have been off chasing pirates, Vader, I've been informed the Death Star construction project has run low on certain resources and labor assets.  I now require your assistance.

I have chosen a system that will provide us with the raw materials and work force necessary for the project.  I suspect the Geonosians won't see the benefit in this.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_21,Darth Vader: As you wish.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_22,Tarkin: I am sure you will.  Assemble your forces and lead the attack personally, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_23,Darth Vader: I will instruct them.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_24,Emperor: Though the Death Star project is of utmost importance, ensure you do not neglect the rest of the Empire.  The informant in our ranks must still be dealt with, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_34,Tarkin: Assemble your forces and lead the attack personally, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_36,Boba Fett: Looks like they've got some drones protecting the sensors…should be easy enough.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_37,Boba Fett: Wha?!  Where did they come from?

TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_71,Darth Vader: Do not overestimate your value to the Empire, Fett, but your services are required here.  Our target is the pirate leader, and he will be taken alive.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_00,Boba Fett: I've deciphered the transmission.  The message to the Jedi came from the planet Thyferra.  The Rebels must have a base there.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_01,Darth Vader: I will see to these Rebels personally.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_07,Stormtrooper: Sir, we've located a Rebel outpost just over the hill.  Looks like they've been using an abandoned communications tower to listen in to our transmissions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_08,Darth Vader: Have the Rebels detected us yet?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_09,Stormtrooper: No sir.  We jammed their sensors before we landed.  We've been holding back waiting for your arrival.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_10,Darth Vader: So much the better.  We will catch them off guard.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_11,Darth Vader: Secure and fortify that location to bring in reinforcements.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_13,Darth Vader: We must take down this shield before we attack.  Destroy the power source before we advance on the base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_15,Stormtrooper: Sir, the Rebels got out a warning before we could secure the communications array.  It's likely the other Rebel groups nearby will be on alert now.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_16,Darth Vader: If this is the best they can muster, the Rebels are of no great concern to the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_17,Stormtrooper: We've found equipment that carries pirate insignias.  The Rebels may be working with them.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_18,Darth Vader: This traitor must be using these pirates to conceal his connections to the Rebellion.  Reconstruct any communication logs you can and inform me as soon as you have something.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_19,Stormtrooper: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_20,Imperial Officer: My lord, reports are coming in from Fondor that Rebel forces have routed our troops and taken control of some local settlements.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_21,Darth Vader: This meaningless retaliation only serves to give away their location.  Eliminate them quickly and recover any communications you may find in the rubble.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_24,Imperial Officer: My lord, we’ve located a small Rebel outpost using the nearby abandoned communications tower to receive Imperial transmissions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_25,Darth Vader: Have the Rebels detected our presence?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_26,Imperial Officer: No, my lord.  We jammed their sensors and communications before we landed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_27,Darth Vader: I hope that you are not mistaken, commander.  We will eliminate the Rebel forces here and discover the identity of the traitor with one swift strike.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_28,Imperial Officer: Yes, sir.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_29,Imperial Officer: Sir! The Rebels got out a warning before we could secure the communications array.  It’s likely that other Rebel groups in the area will…
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_30,Darth Vader: Most unfortunate.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_31,Darth Vader: I warned you of the consequences of failing me, commander.  I can only hope your replacement will be more tactful.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_32,Darth Vader: Trooper, did you find anything in your search?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_33,Stormtrooper: Some of the equipment we’ve found carries pirate insignias.  The Rebels may be working with them.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_34,Darth Vader: They must be trading information on our cargo routes for supplies from the pirates.  Reconstruct their communications.  They will lead us to the Rebellion.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_35,Darth Vader: The Rebels will see no more use from this communications center - destroy it!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_36,Rebel Soldier: Imperial forces! Start the evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_41,Darth Vader: We cannot give away our presence.  Send the probe droid!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_42,Darth Vader: Build a strike force and escort Boba Fett to Ilum.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_43,Darth Vader: Exterminate the Rebel scum on Fondor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_44,Rebel Soldier:  My comm.  hasn’t worked all morning…I have a bad feeling about this.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_45,Rebel Soldier:  Stormtroopers!  They’ve found us!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_46,Rebel Soldier:  Imperial walkers! Engage them immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_47,Rebel Soldier:  Our shield is down!  Attack!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_48,Stormtrooper:  There they are.  Blast 'em!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_49,Stormtrooper:  The communication array is destroyed, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_50,Stormtrooper: The power generator is down.  Finish the rest of the Rebels.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_51,Stormtrooper: These tanks should make short work of their base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_52,Imperial Officer: We’re landing reinforcements, stand by.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_53,Darth Vader: Your incompetence is troubling.  The Rebels were clearly alerted to our presence.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_54,Imperial Officer: My Lord, it is likely the traitor we are hunting may have… (choke)
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_55,Darth Vader: You've failed me for the last time, Commander.  I will be better off without your services.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_56,Stormtrooper: Lord Vader has retreated! Fall back!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_57,Emperor: I expect more from my apprentice, Lord Vader.  This pitiful Rebellion should be no match for a Sith.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_58,Darth Vader: I must see to this task personally.  Thyferra cannot be lost to the Rebellion.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_59,Hint: Use Boba Fett's Seismic Charge to destroy entire groups of enemy fighters.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_60,Rebel Soldier: It's Vader! Run for your lives!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_61,Rebel Soldier: That's Darth Vader! Let's get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_62,Rebel Soldier: Blasters are no match for a lightsaber! Find some cover!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_71,Darth Vader: Here is the power generator.  Attack it at once.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_72,Darth Vader: Fondor has been subjugated.  Have you intercepted any information about our traitor?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_73,Imperial Officer:  The communication array is destroyed, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_05,Stormtrooper: We've lost a prison facility!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_06,Stormtrooper: If we lose one more prison, we will not be able to maintain control on Kashyyyk!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_07,Stormtrooper: We've lost too many prison facilities - we must withdraw!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_08,Tarkin: I cannot understand how a former Imperial would waste such effort on a primitive and inferior race.  The slaves we lost were inconsequential since we still control their homeworld.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_09,Boba Fett: This Solo could be more trouble than you think.  Should I consider him my next target?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_11,Stormtrooper: Don't allow the prison facilities to be destroyed - if the Wookiees get weapons the revolt will be much more difficult to quell.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_12,Han Solo: It looks like I'm not the only one who thinks the Wookiees deserve better.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_13,Han Solo: One down, three to go.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_14,Han Solo: That's two.  I thought the Empire was supposed to be tough.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_15,Stormtrooper: The traitor Solo was wounded, but he escaped into the trees.  He won't get far.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_16,Imperial Officer: Locate him if you can.  We must make an example of him.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_17,Darth Vader: We have more important matters, bounty hunter.  Only someone with authority could have allowed the Rebels to land without detection.  The traitor may be more important than we originally thought.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_18,Imperial Officer: How did the Rebels slip past our blockade?  We're being outmaneuvered, signal the retreat!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_19,Tarkin: Your inability to compensate for changes on the battlefield makes you an ineffective commander.  Consider yourself on probation until this matter is resolved.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_20,Imperial Officer: Incoming Rebel units!  How did they get here?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_05,Imperial Officer: This world is now under the control of the Empire.  You will submit to the will of the Emperor!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_06,Imperial Officer: This world is now under the control of the Empire.  You will submit to the will of the Emperor!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_07,Imperial Officer: We have crushed your defenses.  You are helpless.  Inform your citizens that the Empire has taken control of your world!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_08,Tarkin: These creatures are quite resourceful.  Keep one for me - I could use a new servant.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_09,Imperial Officer: Sir, we have been informed by our outpost on Kashyyyk that a former Imperial Officer is inciting the Wookiees to riot.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_10,Tarkin: See to it that the situation is dealt with.  The Death Star requires additional labor and each of these brutes is worth two of anything else.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_11,Imperial Officer: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_12,Imperial Officer: All hands!  A Mon Calamari capital ship has entered the area.  Be prepared for heavy fire!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_13,Han Solo: C’mon - what are you waiting for, an invitation?  Get some weapons and secure those reinforcement points!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_14,Darth Vader: I am finished with your task, so now I must continue my search for the elusive traitor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_15,Tarkin: There is very little this informant could do to lessen the might of the Empire.  The subjugation of the Geonosians will surely send a clear message to all those who would consider opposing us.  The Rebellion won't be so bold again.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_16,Emperor: The Rebel's strength will continue to grow as long as they continue to acquire allies.  To that end, the potential firepower of the Mon Calamari fleet far exceeds that of the Rebels, and it would be a detriment if they joined forces.  We must insure this does not occur.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_17,Emperor: This uprising on Kashyyyk must be dealt with as efficiently as the Mon Calamari revolt.  Eliminate all who show opposition.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_18,Imperial Officer: The Mon Calamari defenses are too great - signal the retreat! I'll inform Lord Vader…
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_19,Tarkin: We are not sending a clear enough message to the Mon Calamari.  Ensure this revolt does not become a problem.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_05,Veers: Welcome to the Imperial prototype demonstration field, to witness the first full test of our new All Terrain Armored Transport.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_06,Veers: As you can clearly see, the AT-AT is specifically built for difficult terrain.  Note the four-legged design is able to trample defensive barriers with ease!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_07,Veers: The sheer weight of this assault transport is formidable - watch it crush our feeble enemies under his foot!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_08,Hint: Crush lighter vehicles and infantry with the AT-AT by walking over them.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_09,Veers: Now, observe the destructive firepower of the AT-AT.  Just a few volleys at the targets will do.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_10,Hint: Use the AT-AT's Maximum Firepower special ability to destroy targets faster.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_12,Emperor: Tarkin, what do you have to report?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_13,Tarkin: The Death Star is proceeding ahead of schedule your majesty, thanks to the new labor forces from Geonosis and Kashyyyk.  We have directed the surplus in supplies to various technological advances.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_14,Emperor: I am pleased with your progress.  I have been informed of Colonel Veers and his new weapon of war.  I shall be watching the demonstration remotely - it should prove most interesting… both you and Lord Vader should view it as well.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_15,Tarkin: Colonel Veers is of the opinion that the Rebel base that launched the attack could not be far away based on the size of their force.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_16,Darth Vader: I have used his information to pinpoint Jabiim as the likely origin point.  Allow me to take a force there and crush them once and for all!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_17,Emperor: More important than destroying their worthless base of operations is finding the identity of the one who revealed the location of this demonstration, my apprentice.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_19,DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_20,Veers: The AT-AT can handle ground troops in a variety of ways - observe as I deploy stormtroopers from the belly of the beast!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_22,Veers: Special thanks to the Imperial Prison System for providing our gracious test subjects today.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_23,Veers: Even the formidable Rancor is no match for the AT-AT!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_25,Veers: What's this?  It looks like Rebel soldiers are invading.  Not to worry.  They pose no threat to the AT-AT.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_26,Announcer: DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_27,Veers: Thank you, your highness, for watching this demonstration.  As you can see the AT-AT is clearly capable of handling even the most… surprising of situations.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_28,Stormtrooper: We've lost a bunker!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_29,Stormtrooper: We've only got one bunker left - protect it at all costs!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_32,Stormtrooper: We've received the general retreat signal - regroup and prepare for evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_33,Emperor: A less than impressive demonstration, Colonel Veers.  I question the need for such ineffective expenses.  Perhaps your next demonstration won't be as clumsy.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_34,Emperor: I specifically requested a demonstration from Colonel Veers.  Ensure he is present.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_36,Darth Vader: I am needed elsewhere, my master.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_37,Tarkin: And with the Death Star soon fully operational, we will have no need for ground assaults in the future.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_38,Emperor: Both of you will witness this demonstration.  I see it as a seminal moment for the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_39,Emperor: Excellent work, Colonel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_40,Emperor: Most impressive.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_41,Emperor: That is a weapon truly worthy of the Imperial army.  Good work, Colonel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_42,Tarkin: I still don't believe we'll need such a machine once the Death Star has been unleashed upon the unsuspecting galaxy.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_43,Darth Vader: We will trace the traitor from his base and he will be my next target, my master.  He will not escape me.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_45,Emperor: I foresee Veers' new weapon being even more successful than you could imagine, Tarkin.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_46,Imperial Officer: The prototype has been destroyed!  Evacuate immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_04,Imperial Officer: Sir, we're having trouble apprehending Moff Kalast.  His Star Destroyer is one of the newer models, and we've been unable to successfully engage him before he enters hyperspace.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_05,Tarkin: Indeed.  This seems to be an excellent time to test our newest weapon.  I will see to it that an Interdictor Cruiser is placed at your disposal on Coruscant.  We shall see how elusive his Star Destroyer is… .
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_06,Emperor: Moff Kalast was most forthcoming… just before the end.  It seems, Tarkin, that the Bothans have chosen a side in this conflict.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_07,Tarkin: What would you have me do, your majesty?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_08,Emperor: Nothing.  Continue with the Death Star.  I will take care of this personally….  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_09,Tarkin: Obviously you underestimate the cost to produce Interdictors!  I will give you another chance, but the next one you lose will not be replaced so easily.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_10,DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_11,Tarkin: Moff Kalast, you have been ordered to stand down.  Surrender your vessel immediately or face the consequences.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_12,Emperor: I look forward speaking with this traitor myself.  Excellent work, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_13,Imperial Officer: We have received word that the traitor has been spotted.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_14,Imperial Officer: We have engaged Kalast, but he managed to escape to hyperspace.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_15,Imperial Officer: The traitor has jumped out of the system.  We will continue to monitor all channels for word of his whereabouts.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_18,Imperial Officer: Signal the full retreat!  Prepare for hyperspace!  We must (static)
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_19,Tarkin: Moff Kalast has proven elusive.  Still, even the most grand tacticians have their weaknesses.  Ensure he is held accountable for these crimes!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_20,Kalast: You'll have to catch me first.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_21,Tarkin: The length of time it took you to find him may have left my battle station at risk, Lord Vader.  I may need you to secure it for me now that you have finished the Emperor's bidding.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_04,Bothan: Welcome to Bothawui your majesty!  To what to we owe this great honor?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_05,Emperor: Your disloyalty to the Empire!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_06,Emperor: You have earned the wrath of the Empire.  Do not betray us again, or the cost will be even greater next time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_07,Tarkin: Lord Vader, I have need of your skills once again.  Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan is due to receive a transmission from Rebel agents concerning the Death Star.  I have already sent an Interdictor fleet to the area to aid you.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_08,Darth Vader: What would you have me do with the Princess?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_09,Tarkin: I believe a thorough interrogation is in order, after which the Rebellion will be destroyed once and for all.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_10,Darth Vader: I will leave at once.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_11,Imperial Officer: I'm not receiving a signal from the Emperor's shuttle! Something must have gone wrong - order the evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_12,Darth Vader: Master, I sense you are wounded.  Let me handle the Bothawui matter in your stead.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_13,Emperor: A gracious but unnecessary gesture, Vader.  As you well know, matters of disloyalty must be tended to personally.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_14,Emperor: You underestimate the power of the dark side.  How foolish of you to think I cannot handle this matter alone!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_04,Darth Vader: Report on your findings.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_05,Stormtrooper: We found indications that the Rebels have had access to a great deal of coded Imperial data, some of it is very recent and highly classified.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_06,Darth Vader: Are you certain?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_07,Stormtrooper: They managed to destroy most of the data before we could secure it, but we’ve found a few files that reference the Death Star.  We’re unsure just how much they know about it.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_08,Darth Vader: This traitor in our midst is more powerful than we thought to have this kind of access.  Continue your search.  This Rebel sympathizer is running out of places to hide.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_09,Stormtrooper: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_10,Darth Vader: Master, I am concerned that these Rebels know too much about the Death Star.  We have uncovered evidence which reveals it is Moff Kalast who has betrayed your trust.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_11,Emperor: Not even someone of his rank could learn the full capabilities of the Death Star.  I have made sure that the schematics have been split into sections.  None of our bases ever has more than one segment at a time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_12,Tarkin: You worry too much Lord Vader.  The only thing that the Rebels will learn is that they have no hope against the might of the Death Star.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_13,Emperor: We shall see if your faith is well placed once it has been tested Tarkin.  In the meantime, see to it that no more classified information is handed to the Rebels.  Bring this Moff Kalast to me.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_14,Imperial Officer: We’re getting some strange energy readings from the planet surface.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_15,Tarkin: What kind of readings?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_16,Tarkin: Ion cannons!  Keep your distance from the planet!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_17,Imperial Officer: A Mon Calamari ship has entered system space!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_18,Imperial Officer: We have the element of surprise.  Destroy the Rebels and then secure their databanks.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_19,Captain Antilles: DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_20,Emperor: Perhaps I have overestimated your capability.  Like an open wound, the Rebels at Jabiim inspire hope with their short-lived victory.  Correct your error, or I shall find your replacement!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_04,Imperial Officer: A Rebel fleet has just arrived from hyperspace, my Lord!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_05,Darth Vader: It is a useless gesture.  They cannot prevent the end of Alderaan!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_07,Tarkin: She lied to us!  The remains of a Rebel base at Dantooine had been abandoned for some time.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_08,Darth Vader: No matter.  Any further resistance will soon be crushed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_09,Tarkin: What of the Princess and her collaborators?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_10,Darth Vader: They have been allowed to escape.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_11,Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader, this had better work.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_12,Darth Vader: Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable; it will be some time before we can extract any information from her.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_13,Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion… .
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_14,Darth Vader: What do you mean?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_15,Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.  Set your course for Alderaan.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_17,Imperial Officer: The Rebels have broken through! Inform the Death Star, we are unable to interrupt their defenses!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_18,Tarkin: A mere setback, yet completely avoidable.  Have the fleet commander report to me directly for dismissal.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_19,Tarkin: And how might I ask would one effectively demonstrate the firepower of the Death Star without it being present?  Set its course for Alderaan immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_04,Imperial Officer: Lord Vader, request immediate assistance! Pirate raider party engaged, taking casualties!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_05,Darth Vader: Witness the awful vengeance of the Empire against its enemies, Commander! 
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_06,Imperial Officer: That's all of them.  Thank you for the assistance.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_07,Imperial Officer: We’re picking up Rebel transmissions from a nearby sector.  They should be within range within moments.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_08,Darth Vader: Move the fleet into the nebulas to avoid detection.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_09,Blue Leader: All clear!  Stand by to receive transmission
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_10,Darth Vader: Now!  Capture her quickly!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_11,Rebel Captain: Sector's clear.  We have go for jump window.  Repeat.  We have go for jump window.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_12,Imperial Officer: The princess has jumped to hyperspace!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_13,Darth Vader: You fools!  I said capture her, not destroy her!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_14,Imperial Officer: The ship has been neutralized.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_15,Darth Vader: Your diplomatic immunity is worthless now, Rebel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_16,Blue Leader: Imperial forces detected!  Abort mission!  Abort!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_17,Rebel Captain: Jump complete.  Begin the sweep, and stay alert!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_18,Darth Vader: Wait until the Princess acknowledges the transmission before moving on them… .
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_19,Captain Antilles: Imperial forces, we are on a diplomatic mission.  You have no authority here to detain us.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_20,Imperial Officer: We’ve detected a burst transmission to the Princess’ ship, and a confirmation tag.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_21,Blue Leader: Imperial forces!  It’s a trap!  Get the Princess out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_22,Darth Vader: Bring the Interdictors on-line to block the Rebels’ escape!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_23,Darth Vader: The Death Star plans were not found in the Rebel ship's memory banks.  We are searching the nearby systems.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_24,Tarkin: It's of no consequence.  The Death Star has been completed and is ready for testing.  Once we persuade her to reveal the Rebels' location, we will test this station on their hidden base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_25,Darth Vader: Those Interdictors must be protected.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_26,Imperial Officer: All Interdictors have been destroyed, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_27,Darth Vader: You have failed me for the last time, commander.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_28,Imperial Officer: We've lost one of our Interdictors!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_29,Imperial Officer: There's only one Intedictor left.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_30,Darth Vader: Long-range scanners have picked up a Rebel scouting party.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_31,Darth Vader: Hold your fire until the Princess receives the transmissions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_32,Blue Leader: This is Blue Squadron initiating sector sweep.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_33,Captain Antilles: Roger that, Blue Leader, standing by.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_34,Blue Leader: It's quiet…too quiet.  Didn't intel report a heavy pirate presence here?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_35,Blue Leader: Base, this is Blue Leader, Tatooine space is clear.  We are go for jump.  Repeat, we are go for jump.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_36,Darth Vader: Clear the sector of all pirates, they must not interfere with our plans.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_37,Darth Vader: Time is running out, destroy all the pirates!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_38,Darth Vader: The Princess must be kept alive.  Use the Star Destroyer's Tractor Beam to capture her ship.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_39,Captain Antilles: The Imperial forces are retreating!  Concentrate your fire on their remaining vessels!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_40,Tarkin: I am surprised, Lord Vader.  Beaten by the Princess and her entourage!  No matter, she will not escape us next time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_41,Darth Vader: Fool!  The capture of the Princess has been entrusted to me!  Requisition a Star Destroyer, we will use the Tractor Beam to subdue her.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_03,Emperor: Lord Vader, I have a final task for you….
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_04,Darth Vader: What is thy bidding my master?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_05,Emperor: I have sensed that this Rebellion is seeking, in its final desperate hours, to attack the Death Star.  They have managed to consolidate their forces on five worlds.  Destroy them.  All of them!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_06,Darth Vader: It shall be done.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_07,Tarkin: What of the Death Star, your majesty?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_08,Emperor: Use it’s full destructive power against them!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_09,Imperial Officer: Sir, I've analyzed their attack and there is a danger.  Shall I have your shuttle standing by?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_10,Tarkin: Evacuate?  In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_11,Imperial Officer: Yes, sir….
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_12,Imperial Officer: The Rebels have destroyed the Death Star!  Contact Lord Vader immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_13,Imperial Officer: DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_14,Darth Vader: Regroup with the others.  My master will know how to proceed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_15,Darth Vader: The Force was strong with him.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_16,Darth Vader: The Force was strong with that one.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_17,Stormtrooper: The planet has been destroyed, sir.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_18,Darth Vader: Impressive.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_19,Tarkin: Was there ever any doubt?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_20,Emperor: Yes!  I can feel their pain… .
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_21,Emperor: Now that they have nowhere else to run, the Rebel leaders have fled to Yavin.  Ensure there are no survivors, Tarkin.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_22,Tarkin: It will be my pleasure, your majesty.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_24,Imperial Officer: Yavin had been destroyed, my Lord.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_25,Emperor: All our efforts will have been in vain if the Death Star is used so ineffectively.  It takes a ruthless warrior to wield such a powerful weapon.  Do not fail me again!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_26,Tarkin: I believe the Emperor specifically requested the use of the Death Star.  What a waste, to build such a grand weapon and let it languish!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_27,Vader: You are gaining the Emperor's attention.  He has rewarded you for your recent accomplishments.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_28,Vader: Imperial resources are being redirected to those who know how to use them.  Do not squander this generous gift from the Emperor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_29,Vader: My master is pleased with your expected victory, and has assigned you additional Imperial assets.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_30,Vader: This victory brings us ever closer to crushing the Rebellion for good.  These supplies will further your efforts for the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_31,Tarkin: It seems our offensive is proceeding according to plan.  Soon, the Rebellion will be no more.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_32,Emperor: I sense their end is indeed at hand.  Ensure you use the Death Star effectively, to avoid any unnecessary ground conflict.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_33,Tarkin: It shall be done, your highness.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_34,Tarkin: I find it amusing to see such courage in the face of inevitability.  The Rebels throw themselves at the fire so willingly.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_35,Emperor: Their faith in their leaders is strong, Tarkin.  Unfortunately, faith alone will not be enough to save them from the might of the Death Star.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_36,Tarkin: As you can see, Lord Vader, our efforts were not in vain.  Like a cornered animal, the Rebellion panics in its last gasps for survival.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_37,Darth Vader: Do not celebrate victory prematurely, Tarkin.  Cornered animals are known for their ferocity.  We must show them no mercy!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_38,Darth Vader: Master, the Rebellion has been reduced to a mere pocket of resistance.  Complete control of the galaxy is at hand.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_39,Emperor: It is as I have foreseen, my apprentice.  Our years of toil are finally coming to an end.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_INVALID_ACTION,Imperial Officer: You're not authorized to do that!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_01,Rise my friend.  This day has seen the end of the last Jedi Knight and the Rebellion.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_02,There is nothing to stop us now, my master!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_03,It is all as I have foreseen!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_04,(evil cackling laughter)
TEXT_SPEECH_ENDOR_BND_VICTORY_COR18_01,Defiler: I've successfully set up a series of slave pits to transform the little captured Ewoks into exploding slave units. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ERIADU_BLK_VICTORY_COR19_02,Defiler: The already established Eriadu black market, which we now control, is bringing technology into the Zann Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_ERIADU_RKT_VICTORY_COR19_01,Defiler: Systems have been set up on the orbital habitats. We'll now attempt to lure enemies to the system in order to destroy their ships and then claim them as salvage
TEXT_SPEECH_FELUCIA_BRB_VICTORY_COR20_01,Defiler: The Commerce Guild associates are now in the Zann Consortium pockets. Long live Tyber Zann!
TEXT_SPEECH_FELUCIA_RKT_VICTORY_COR20_02,Defiler: Racketeering is spreading surprisingly fast on the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_00,Tyber Zann: Take this Saboteur, corrupt Nal Hutta, and then report back to me.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_00B,Tyber Zann: Take this Saboteur, corrupt Kashyyyk, and then report back to me.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_01,Hint: Drag the saboteur to the 'Spread Corruption' slot on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_01B,Hint: Drag the saboteur to the 'Spread Corruption' slot on Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_02,Tyber Zann: Good!  Our influence has been spread to Kashyyyk.  As long as Kashyyyk remains corrupted we can access the Black Market that is in place on that planet.  Now, direct my lieutenant to purchase Stealth Technology from the Black Market on Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_03,Hint: Drag Silri to the 'Buy' slot on Kashyyyk and choose Cloaking Technology from the purchase menu.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_04,Tyber Zann: Kashyyyk is crawling with Imperial units, so we will need to find another target if we're going to expand our operations.  Capturing Felucia would allow us to build a larger army.  Take this Saboteur to Felucia, and spread our corruption influence on that planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_05,Tyber Zann: As you might have already guessed - they're called Saboteurs for a reason.  Move this Saboteur to Felucia, and destroy the Ion Cannon that the Rebels have built.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_06,Hint: Drag the saboteur to the 'Sabotage' slot on Felucia and destroy the Ion Cannon.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_07,Tyber Zann: Felucia is our goal, but we do not want to draw the attention of the Empire... yet.  We will bribe our way past Kashyyyk, and attack the Rebels at Felucia.  Combine all of our space forces at Nal Hutta, and move them to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_08,Hint: To see the cost to bribe your way to a planet, drag your force to your final destination without letting go of the mouse button.  The bribe cost will be listed next to your fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_09,Hint: Include Tyber in the invading space fleet and bring all of our space units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_10,Tyber Zann: Now that we have secured the space above Felucia, we can use our land forces to conquer the planet.  Bring all of our land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_11,Hint: Bring all of our land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_12,Tyber Zann: Remember to use the abilities of our heroes to gain an upper hand in this battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_13,Tyber Zann: Excellent.  We can now use Felucia to produce advanced ships.  I will leave it to you to capture the remaining planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_14,Hint: Use the saboteur to spread corruption to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_15,Hint: Conquer the remaining planets in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_16,Tyber Zann: Our Mercenaries are equipped with disruptor technology from the Black Market.  Switch to these weapons when fighting enemy infantry.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_17,Tyber Zann: Make sure you include Tyber in the invading fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_18,Tyber Zann: Their forces are too powerful; we can't take them on just yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_19,Tyber Zann: A bunker!  We can use these structures to protect our infantry, and to hold key areas of the battlefield.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_20,Tyber Zann: This terrain is far too dense for vehicles, but infantry will have no problems traveling through this area.  Let's use this to our advantage.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_21,Tyber Zann: Since we have Destroyers in orbit, we can order an orbital bombardment.   This Rebel base would be an ideal target for this new weapon.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_22,Tyber Zann: This would be an ideal time to use the cloaking technology that we purchased on the Black Market.  Use this ability on our Vengeance-Class ships to launch a sneak attack on the nearby Rebel turrets.  They'll never know what hit them.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_23,Tyber Zann: The enemy has bomber units, but we did not come unprepared.  We can easily counter these pests by using the defensive systems on our new Crusader Gunships.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_24,Tyber Zann: We are not bound by the same restrictions that plague our enemies.  There will be no Imperial bureaucracy to slow us down; and we do not follow a righteous moral code as the Rebels do.  NOTHING will stand in the way of our success.  We will corrupt, sabotage, and then annihilate our enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_25,Tyber Zann: We need money!  We must spread corruption to nearby planets with our Saboteurs.  Once it has been established, our corruption influence will automatically begin extorting a percentage of the planetary income.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_26,Tyber Zann: Zoom in 2X on corrupted planets to see the positions of enemy structures and forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_27,Tyber Zann: Ah, very nice...  Imperial cloaking technology.  It would have been a steal at twice that price!
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_28,Tyber Zann: Whenever an enemy planet has been corrupted we can spy on the activity on that planet. In this case, it appears that the Rebel Alliance is defending Felucia with an Ion Cannon. I hate surprises...
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_29,Tyber Zann: Everyone has a price… use my Bribery ability to sway enemy units to our cause.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_30,Tyber Zann: Unlike the Rebel and Empire, these asteroids pose no threat to our ships.  We can use this ability as part of our tactics, to hide or evade the enemy
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_31,Tyber Zann: This Rebel space station is heavily shielded, but our Keldabe ship has the ability to drain enemy's shields.  Let's use their own shields against them!
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_32,Hint: You can zoom in 2X to configure all of your bases to your liking.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_33,Tyber Zann: Since this planet has been corrupted by our influence, we will receive a bounty for every enemy that we kill.  Apparently, crime does pay.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_34,Tyber Zann: Thanks to our advanced recon we have been able to pin point the location of the rebel power generator. Unfortunately it lies within an area traversable only by infantry.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_35,Tyber Zann: Destroying the power generator will render the Rebel base shield useless and allow us to launch an assault on their base.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_36,Hint: As long as their base shield is active our planetary bombardment is useless against their factories.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_37,Hint: A Saboteur spreads the will of Tyber Zann across the galaxy by infiltrating and corrupting a planet using bribery, extortion, and assassination.  This takes time to complete and the percentage of corruption will build up until a planet is completely corrupted.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_38,Hint: From this Advanced Base Layout screen, the owner of the planet can arrange any troops and base structures to better defend it.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_39,Hint: Technology purchased from the black market will vary depending on which faction currently owns the planet.  The cost to steal a certain technology will vary depending on the current tech level of the enemy that you are stealing from.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_40,Hint: The cost to destroy each structure is displayed next to it. For our purposes, the Ion Cannon is the only structure that is affordable to sabotage.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_41,Tyber Zann: Direct these mercenaries to enter the bunker by selecting them and clicking on the bunker.  This will garrison them inside the bunker and protect them from any damage, while allowing them to fire upon any nearby enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_42,Hint: To call down reinforcements, click the Call for Reinforcements button.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_43,Hint: Now drag the F9-TZ Transport company from the reinforcement window to your reinforcement point on the land map.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_44,Tyber Zann: Now that those pests have been taken care of, we need to take out that shield generator.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_45,Hint: Load your units into the troop transport by selecting them and clicking on the transport unit, then move the transport to the designated area.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_46,Hint: Some areas are impassable to vehicles and can only be reached by infantry.  Eject your troops and send them to the shield generator.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_47,Tyber Zann: Now that our way is clear, take our forces and destroy the enemy’s base. 
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_CRM_VICTORY_COR21_05,Defiler: The highly valuable indigenous units of Fondor are now ours to use as we see fit. 
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_LOAD_COR21_01,Bossk: I'll not be denied. Move your ships into place!
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_LOSS_COR21_04,Bossk:  Now I want to go back into the fight and finish the job I started. 
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_OBJECTIVE_02,Destroy the enemy space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_TACTICAL_COR21_02,Bossk: The Fondor space stations are extremely powerful. We must maneuver our forces to destroy one completely.
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_VICTORY_COR21_03,Bossk: My forces have succeeded where others would have failed. A bit more of the Empire is lost to their use. 
TEXT_SPEECH_FRESIA_BRB_VICTORY_COR22_01,Defiler: The Incom Corporation has proven cooperative. The Consortium expands greatly with this acquisition.
TEXT_SPEECH_FRESIA_CRM_VICTORY_COR22_02,Defiler: We gain another powerful piece of military hardware. The Consortium grows even stronger!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_01,Bossk: There's our target!  Move in!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_02,IG-88: Target located!  Proceed!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_03,Silri: Our prey has been revealed!  Strike now!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_04,Tyber: There's our target.  Execute the plan.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_05,Urai: Our target presents itself.  Concentrate there.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_06,Consortium Soldier: There's our target!  Move in!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_07,Defiler: I can't corrupt that system.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_08,Defiler: I am unable to spread corruption there.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_09,Defiler: Corruption won't work there.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_10,Defiler: That system can't be corrupted.
TEXT_SPEECH_GEONOSIS_BND_VICTORY_COR23_02,Defiler: Enslaving this planet's people will have a major effect on the makeup of Imperial troop deployments.
TEXT_SPEECH_GEONOSIS_CRM_VICTORY_COR23_01,Defiler: We have discovered the manufacture points of droids on the planet and new force pools are in transit to Zann forces. 
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_00,Rebels are blatantly making their presence known in the streets!  Deploying some troops on the surface should remove any traitorous thoughts from their heads.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_01,There can be no diplomacy with Rebels!  Deploy some troops and show them how we negotiate!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_02,This planet is at risk of falling into the hands of the Rebellion!  Mount a defense that will send them crawling back into their holes.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_03,Removing their land bases in the area would go a long way in helping us keep the Rebellion out of our space.  See to it.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_04,We have found the Rebel leader Mon Mothma.   Go now and remove the plague that has infested the Empire once and for all!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_05,This last bastion of Rebel hope will quickly fade once we have eliminated their final base of operation.   Go now and do the Emperor's bidding.   Our  complete victory is at hand!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_00,Our intelligence officers have discovered that a hostile fleet has evaded our orbital defenses and are landing their forces.  I need you to scout the area and find a weakness.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_01,The best defense is a good offense.  Go out and capture all the landing locations.  The enemy will be unable to send in reinforcements and will fall to our greater numbers.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_02,Rebel cells are showing their faces across the galaxy.  We can't allow them to burrow into the Empire like worms.  Show them that their aggressions against the Empire will not be tolerated.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_03,The ground bases are the backbone of our defenses.  We need to increase their number if we are to teach the Rebellion that their cause is a losing proposition.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_04,A small force of Rebels has infiltrated our outer defenses and landed somewhere on the planet surface.  Seek out and remove them immediately.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_05,Remove the Rebel presence from the surface of the planet immediately!   We must take every precaution to ensure that the Emperor is not harmed.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_00,These vagrants stand in our way.  Eliminate them to prepare for our land invasion.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_01,This pitiful force is preventing our assault on this system.  Dispatch them so that we can secure orbit for the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_02,Sensors are reporting that there is a hostile presence surrounding the planet.  Lay waste to any forces that oppose the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_03,Let's show these dissidents who rules this galaxy. Remove their influence from this system by destroying all their defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_04,This is a momentous occasion for the Empire!   Bring the Death Star in range of the planet and show this pitiful insurgency the true power of this fully functional battle station!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_00,You've let unidentified ships slip through our perimeter! Send a fleet to investigate.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_01,Our sensors are reporting that a fleet is incoming.  Show them how we deal with traitors.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_02,We will not be threatened by these thugs.  See to it that their fleet is destroyed.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_03,Our hold on this system must not be compromised.  Seek out and destroy every intruder to our system.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_04,This Rebel scum must be forced out of orbit.   Ensure that the Emperor is not harmed.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_05,This Rebel scum must be forced out of orbit.   Ensure that the Death Star is protected from the invading force.

TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_R_01,We need to deploy more troops, or we will not last long against the enemy forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_R_02,Strike at the heart of the enemy!  Take out their structures and their ground forces will retreat.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_R_03,Sometimes the best path is not a direct one.  Scout out all the options before leading your forces to the enemy base.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_R_04,Take a small force and inflict whatever damage you can on the enemy.   Sometimes the most surgical of strikes can strike a deadly blow.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_R_00,Reports have revealed that a hostile force is closing in on us.  Try scouting the area and find a weakness.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_R_01,The enemy is landing their forces as we speak.  Fortify our defenses and stave off their attack.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_R_02,Our defense must hold.  The innocent people of this planet are depending on us.  Build defenses and fortify those locations with Alliance forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_R_03,Use the terrain to your advantage.  We must repel this invasion if the Rebellion is to survive.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_R_04,Enemy transports are landing near our base.   We must protect Mon Mothma at all costs - or the Alliance is certainly doomed!
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_R_05,You are our last hope.  We must defend our only remaining base.   Our loss will be the ultimate defeat of the Rebellion.   May the Force be with you!
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_R_00,We're advancing on the enemy stronghold.  This presence must be eliminated before we can liberate the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_R_01,We suspect that this planet's defenses could be very powerful.   We're counting on you to remove all enemy forces protecting the planet to allow our ground forces through.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_R_02,Destroying key elements of the enemy's forces is an optimal tactic.  Try to separate the defending units to pick them apart.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_R_03,A larger force doesn't always guarantee victory.  Use tactics to you advantage and remove the defending position.
TEXT_SPEECH_GRS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_R_04,Mon Mothma has accompanied us into battle.   We must protect her at all costs - or the Alliance is certainly doomed!

TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_U_04,Take a small force and inflict whatever damage you can on the enemy.   Sometimes the most surgical of strikes can strike a deadly blow.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_U_00,Reports have revealed that a hostile force is closing in on us.  Try scouting the area and find a weakness.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_U_01,The enemy is landing their forces as we speak.  Fortify our defenses and stave off their attack.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_U_02,Our defense must hold.  We have a lot invested in this planet.  Build defenses and fortify those locations with Consortium forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_U_03,Use the terrain to your advantage.  We must repel this invasion if the Zann Consortium is to survive.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_U_04,Enemy transports are landing near our base.   We must protect Tyber Zann at all costs - or the Zann Consortium is certainly doomed!
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_U_05,This is our last hope.  We must defend our only remaining base.   Our loss will be the ultimate defeat of the Zann Consortium.  
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_LAND_INDIGENOUS_U_00,The indigenous population has accepted Tyber's generous offer and will fight on our behalf.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_00,We're advancing on the enemy stronghold.  This presence must be eliminated before we can liberate the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_01,We suspect that this planet's defenses could be very powerful.   We're counting on you to remove all enemy forces protecting the planet to allow our ground forces through.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_02,Destroying key elements of the enemy's forces is an optimal tactic.  Try to separate the defending units to pick them apart.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_03,A larger force doesn't always guarantee victory.  Use tactics to you advantage and remove the defending position.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_04,Tyber Zann has accompanied our fleet into battle.   We must protect him at all costs - or the Zann Consortium is certainly doomed!
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_05,Our chance for victory has come at long last.   Destroying the enemy's leader will shatter the their resolve and open the galaxy to our control.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_06,The Death Star is in orbit above the planet.  Our forces will not be able to withstand that kind of firepower.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_U_07,Destroying the Death Star will shatter the Imperial menace and remove them from the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_00,Our captain has informed me that an enemy fleet is closing in on us.  We must protect our investment in this planet.  Good Luck!
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_01,We've been discovered by the enemy.  Be prepared to defend our position and repel the aggressors.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_02,Our scanners have detected a hostile fleet moving towards our location.  Their presence in our system must be removed.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_03,Enemy ships have hyperspaced to our location.   These invaders must never set foot on the planet surface.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_04,Enemy ships have appeared on our scanners.   We must protect Tyber Zann at all costs - or the Zann Consortium is certainly doomed!
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_05,The Death Star is quickly approaching the planet.   All units attack!  We cannot withstand battle station's firepower.
TEXT_SPEECH_GUS_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_U_06,The Death Star is quickly approaching.   We must use all our available resources to stop this threat once and for all.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_LOAD_COR25_01,Urai Fen: We move as quickly otherwise our forces will be overwhelmed by Noghri assassins. I have heard boastful rumors of their battle skills, so this should be a good challenge.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_LOSS_COR25_05,Urai Fen: We tried our best but their forces were just too much.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_TACTICAL_COR25_02,Urai Fen: What the Noghri assassins of Honoghr lack in numbers they make up for in skill. If we can destroy three of their base camp structures it will send a strong message.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_VICTORY_COR25_04,Urai Fen: Even Vader's assassins proved no match for our forces. This victory ensures that word of the Zann Consortium spreads quickly.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_RKT_VICTORY_COR25_06,Defiler: Rigged games of chance and fixed bouts of combat should bring credits to our organization. Once the galaxy sees the defeat of the Noghri at our hands, fewer will stand in our way.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_STORY_INT_TACTICAL_COR25_03,Urai Fen: Destroying the base camps and killing Commander Malinth will open this planet up for corruption and lessen Imperial influence. My blades are sharpened and ready for battle. 
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_STORY_INT_TACTICAL_COR25_07,Defiler: There's our target!  Move in!
TEXT_SPEECH_HOTH_RKT_VICTORY_COR24_01,Defiler: As ordered we have spread our Racketeering efforts over the sparsely inhabited planet. Zann's plans are accelerating.
TEXT_SPEECH_HYPORI_BLK_VICTORY_COR52_01,Defiler: Hypori's black market has become the place to buy all the latest technology, and the Consortium is making a killing with the kickbacks.
TEXT_SPEECH_ILUM_BRB_VICTORY_COR26_01,Defiler: We have acquired a great deal of Jedi knowledge that is being reviewed. This information should be useful in allowing the Consortium to push on in this sector. 
TEXT_SPEECH_JABIIM_CRM_VICTORY_COR27_02,Defiler: Now that the militia has been corrupted, enemy fleet movements will be tracked and turned over to our spies. 
TEXT_SPEECH_JABIIM_RKT_VICTORY_COR27_01,Defiler: I have succeeded in setting up Zann Consortium organizations all over the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_KAMINO_BLK_VICTORY_COR28_02,Defiler: It was unusually easy to form a black market group on this world. New technology data is shipping now. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KAMINO_CRM_VICTORY_COR28_01,Defiler: Corrupting the military forces of the planet will gain the Consortium powerful military forces to use in the upcoming battle. Long live Tyber Zann!
TEXT_SPEECH_KASHYYYK_BND_VICTORY_COR29_02,Defiler: The Zann Consortium now has the use of Wookiees as slaves. They should provide additional brute force.
TEXT_SPEECH_KASHYYYK_RKT_VICTORY_COR29_01,Defiler: I have been successful in setting up an organization that can be used as a model for the Consortium all over the galaxy. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KESSEL_CRM_VICTORY_COR30_05,Defiler: I've successfully corrupted the Kessel miners. The enemy will not appreciate the uprising when the funds are cut to their workers.
TEXT_SPEECH_KESSEL_PIR_LOAD_COR30_01,IG-88: I’ve computed a 98% chance of success, begin the battle!
TEXT_SPEECH_KESSEL_PIR_LOSS_COR30_04,IG-88: My calculations failed, I've even now reevaluated the situation and am ready to try again. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KESSEL_PIR_TACTICAL_COR30_02,IG-88: I am tasked to enter the Kessel system and locate an Imperial Communication Satellite. Securing it will allow us to direct enemy ship movements toward our docks for confiscation.
TEXT_SPEECH_KESSEL_PIR_VICTORY_COR30_03,IG-88: We have succeeded beyond my calculations. We have added a new ship to our fleet. We are redirecting enemy credits into our own coffers. Already we have heard reports of transport ships mysteriously disappearing as a result of our taking over control of the communication satellite.
TEXT_SPEECH_KORRIBAN_RKT_VICTORY_COR31_01,Defiler: While I've been successful in setting up our organization here, we should be wary; there is Dark Force energy in this sector of space.
TEXT_SPEECH_KUAT_BLK_VICTORY_COR32_05,Defiler: The black market is established and we begin gathering important military ship data. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KUAT_KID_LOAD_COR32_01,Bossk: Our victim is weak, but his defenders are powerful. Act quickly. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KUAT_KID_LOSS_COR32_04,Bossk: Our work is not done here. We must try again as soon as possible. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KUAT_KID_TACTICAL_COR32_02,Bossk: Move out and capture Bevel Lemelisk at all costs. His knowledge will greatly enhance Consortium efforts in this sector of space. 
TEXT_SPEECH_KUAT_KID_VICTORY_COR32_03,Bossk: With Bevel Lemelisk in our control, constant sums of credits flow into Consortium accounts. Especially from our vantage point in Kuat. We should be able to broadcast our actions to other systems making our bribery efforts increasingly successful.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANAAN_RKT_VICTORY_COR33_01,Defiler: As expected, we've set up our organization on planet. They are even starting to pay their debts in Kolto.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_BRB_VICTORY_COR34_08,Defiler: I've successfully bribed the warrior clan leader on Mandalore. Mandalorian mercenary forces will now fight only for Zann. They've also agreed to track our enemies movements through their system.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_DIALOG_COR34_10,Tyber Zann: Captain, you would have made a good Consortium leader, too bad you have to die. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_DIALOG_COR34_11,Tyber Zann: You fight bravely, but not wisely. Your time ends now. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_DIALOG_COR34_12,Tyber Zann: You are brave but very foolish to challenge the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_LOAD_COR34_01,Tyber Zann: Men, expect waves of assault ships as we corrupt the planet. The battle isn't over until we have destroyed the Keldabe warship. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_LOSS_COR34_07,Tyber Zann: I'm surrounded by incompetence! I give you one last time to prove yourselves.  Do not fail me again!
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_TACTICAL_COR34_03,Tyber Zann: Facing the Mandalorians will be one of our greatest challenges. I'll face their clan leader in space above the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_VICTORY_COR34_05,Tyber Zann: I've successfully corrupted Mandalore. Victory over the Mandalorians will strike fear in all those who dare to oppose us.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_RKT_VICTORY_COR34_09,Defiler: We've set up our organization on the world and they're responding unusually well to the activities we use to draw off their credits.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_STORY_PIR_LOAD_COR34_02,Tyber Zann: Men, the Zann Consortium expects your best today. If everyone does their part we'll not fail. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_STORY_PIR_TACTICAL_COR34_04,Tyber Zann: We'll be facing the Mandalorian clan chieftans attempting to defend the space above their planet. Their proud warrior tradition means this will be a fight to the death.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_STORY_PIR_VICTORY_COR34_06,Tyber Zann: I've successfully defeated the Mandalorian Chieftain. The continuing raids will soon bring them to their knees.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_01,We received word from some reliable sources.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_02,You have done the Alliance a great service.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONQUER_00,If we don't gain more ground, our cause is finished.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONQUER_01,Your actions have not gone unnoticed.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_00,There are some troubling developments to discuss.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_01,The Empire has made its move and their ships will be exiting hyperspace shortly.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_02,A heroic victory!
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_03,Clearly our intelligence sources underestimated the scale of that assault.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CREDIT_WINDFALL_00,Thank you.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CREDITS_00,Our financial experts are predicting a shortage of credits soon.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_CREDITS_01,I am grateful for your assistance.

TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_04,It was wise of you to realize the trap set by the pirates.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_05,You have proven that you can master any situation, commander.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_06,Not all battles end in victory.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_FLEET_01,An Alliance fleet was recently ambushed and captured.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_FLEET_02,Your actions have not gone unnoticed.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_00,The Empire has suppressed the Rebellion for the last time.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_01,The Rebellion will never fall to the Empire.

TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_03,Your help is in great need, commander.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_00,We have received many reports from our spies concerning the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_01,A great opportunity has passed us by.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_02,Well done, commander!
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_00,Reports are coming in that several Imperial capital ships have been spotted in orbit above a planet controlled by the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_01,The Alliance is in your debt commander.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_00,Word comes to us that the inhabitants of one of the Empire's systems are revolting against their Imperial oppressors.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_01,We’ve received a distress call from a planet revolting against the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_02,This is a sad day, commander.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_03,We have been contacted by the leader of the revolt.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_01,We have received a distress call that cannot be ignored.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_02,Your actions prove your true loyalty to the Alliance and the galaxy. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_PLANET_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_00,One of our allied planets has betrayed us.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_PLANET_WINDFALL_00,Our influences have reached one of the Empire's planets. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_01,A band of underground Alliance supporters have been discovered by the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_02,The consular thanks you for the great service you have performed for him.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_03,That did not turn out as we had hoped.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_01,The Black Sun pirates have requested our assistance.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_02,The pirates have managed to find their leader being held on the surface of that planet. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_00,Some of the Imperial fleets have been moving to areas of space with no strategic value that we can see.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_01,Your investigations have proved most fruitful.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_02,Your actions have strengthened the Alliance.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_01,In some cases, a show of strength is more effective than diplomacy.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_02,With our last victory, we have gained favor with citizens throughout the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_STRUCTURE_00,The Alliance needs every credit it can get.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_STRUCTURE_01,I am in your debt.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,You have done well.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_TRAP_00,Recent Imperial troop movements have created an opportunity to strike and liberate another world.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_TRAP_01,It seems as though the opportunity has passed and Imperial defenses are once again in place.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_TRAP_02,Our fears are realized!
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,I am grateful for your presence, commander.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_UNITS_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have done well in building our forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,You are doing well, but our defenses need to be even stronger.
TEXT_SPEECH_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,Your actions have strengthened our position in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_BND_VICTORY_COR35_05,Defiler: While they won't make aggressive slave troops, there are a lot of them to use as battle fodder. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_PIR_LOAD_COR35_01,IG-88: Resistance will be strong, but calculations indicate a 75% chance of success.
TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_PIR_LOSS_COR35_04,IG-88: I feel certain we'll do better in our second attempt at corrupting them. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_PIR_TACTICAL_COR35_02,IG-88: There are two large space stations working on starship engines. We must destroy them and sift through the ruins for engineering data. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_PIR_VICTORY_COR35_03,IG-88: We're successful and more ship building secrets will come out of corrupting this system. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MUSTAFAR_BRB_VICTORY_COR36_01,Defiler: As expected we have successfully bribed the Techno Union officials. Droids from this world will no longer be manufactured to aid our enemies in this sector.
TEXT_SPEECH_MUSTAFAR_CRM_VICTORY_COR36_02,Defiler: After encountering some difficulty we are successful on this world. If our influence is taken away, we've prepared the planet to revolt from its masters. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MUUNILINST_BRB_VICTORY_COR37_05,Defiler: City officials are now sympathetic to our cause. Consortium affairs will proceed more smoothly in this sector of the galaxy. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MUUNILINST_KID_LOAD_COR37_01,IG-88: I compute a 99% chance of success on this mission. Advance!
TEXT_SPEECH_MUUNILINST_KID_LOSS_COR37_04,IG-88: Our first skirmish took out most of his security task force. It's up to us to raid the planet and take the Chairman.
TEXT_SPEECH_MUUNILINST_KID_TACTICAL_COR37_02,IG-88: Chairman San Hill is here on vacation right now. We'll find and capture him, destroying any enemy units in the way. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MUUNILINST_KID_VICTORY_COR37_03,IG-88: We hold Chairman Hill at this time. He's even now giving us codes to the inner systems of the Intergalactic Banking Clan. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MYRKR_RKT_VICTORY_COR38_01,Defiler: Talon Karrde proved most cooperative when we explained things to him. We've successfully corrupted the planet. 
TEXT_SPEECH_NABOO_BND_VICTORY_COR39_05,Defiler: We're successful and the new troops we gain are proving unusually useful. Long live the Zann Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_NABOO_INT_LOAD_COR39_01,Silri: The chairman must be frightened into never saying No to us again.
TEXT_SPEECH_NABOO_INT_LOSS_COR39_04,Silri: The chairman's guards were unusually powerful. I'll try a new battle plan to win the day. 
TEXT_SPEECH_NABOO_INT_TACTICAL_COR39_02,Silri: The Naboo security forces should be easy prey for us.
TEXT_SPEECH_NABOO_INT_VICTORY_COR39_03,Silri: The chairman has been turned into jibbering idiot. This world will no longer support the enemies of the Zann Consortium. If things change we know who to kill.
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_BLK_VICTORY_COR40_06,Defiler: The Black Market on Nal Hutta is already providing advanced technologies the Consortium can use to boost the power of Zann fleets. 
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_BRB_VICTORY_COR40_05,Defiler: Bribery has worked very well on Nal Hutta. No garrison units will join the side of our enemies from this world. Enemy fleet movements will be reported to us on a daily basis from planet sensors. 
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_CRM_VICTORY_COR40_07,Defiler: The Hutts are trying to please the Consortium enough that we will aid them in their petty squabbles.  As a result, their militia will fight for us if needed.
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_KID_LOAD_COR40_01,Urai Fen: The bogs can be dangerous, strike as quickly as possible, move out. Glory to the Zann Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_KID_LOSS_COR40_04,Urai Fen: There was no way to know the size of the hidden forces we found on Nal Hutta. We'll regroup and attack again soon. 
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_KID_TACTICAL_COR40_02,Urai Fen: Advancing to the space port director's location could be extremely dangerous. Carefully scout all areas for the enemy positions before moving forward.
TEXT_SPEECH_NALHUTTA_KID_VICTORY_COR40_03,Urai Fen: With Tanda the Hutt in our control our operations should run more smoothly in this sector.
TEXT_SPEECH_OBI_HC_01,I thought I sensed a disturbance in the force…
TEXT_SPEECH_OBI_HC_02,You’re only a master of evil.
TEXT_SPEECH_OBI_HC_03,You can’t win.
TEXT_SPEECH_OBI_HC_04,If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine!
TEXT_SPEECH_OBI_HC_05,The dark side cannot succeed for long.
TEXT_SPEECH_PLANET_CONTROL_ACHIEVED,Planetary control achieved.
TEXT_SPEECH_PLANET_CONTROL_LOST,System Lost
TEXT_SPEECH_POLUS_BND_VICTORY_COR41_02,Defiler: Special slave troops are in route to your location. More will be sent as they are needed to further the plans of the Zann Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_POLUS_RKT_VICTORY_COR41_01,Defiler: Our organization is now planet wide. The cold doesn't seem to effect how miners spend their credits.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_03,Antilles: Okay, we have to cause as much destruction as we can.  And be quick about it.  Threepio?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_04,C-3PO: Yes, sir?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_05,Antilles: Have Artoo monitor Imperial comm channels and scan for any chatter about our mission.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_07,Imperial Officer: This is the Kuat shipyard.  We have come under Rebel attack.  Requesting assistance.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_08,Imperial Captain: This is the Tyranny.  Your satellite defenses should be adequate for any Rebel fleet, activate them!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_09,Imperial Captain: The Tyranny is on Imperial Security assignment.  Maintain channel silence for ceremony communications.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_10,Imperial Officer: Kuat shipyard to all Imperial units!  We are under siege by significant Rebel forces!  All ships in the area, respond!  Emergency code zero!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_11,Imperial Captain: This is the Tyranny.  Responding to code zero.  Be aware that you are altering plans set by Lord Vader himself, and you will answer to him if this code has been invoked lightly.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_12,Antilles: Better stay away from the starbase - we can’t match its firepower!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_13,Imperial Captain: Jump completed.  Scanning for Rebel fleet…targets sighted.  Preparing to engage.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_14,Antilles: Looks like we got their attention.  Now lets get out of here.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_15,Antilles: It looks like we didn't cause enough damage to pull their attention away from Fresia.  Prepare the ships.  We'll need to try it again.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_16,Antilles: I've taken heavy damage during the fight.  I'll need to repair the Sundered Heart before I can rejoin you.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_18,Antilles: Keep your distance from that space station - we can't hope to match its firepower with our current forces!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_19,Mon Mothma: The Tyranny and its fleet will most likely remain at their post while it is repaired.  The devastation of Kuat shipyard should prove to be a lengthy distraction. 
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_20,Antilles: Then we've got some X-wings on Fresia to attend to.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_21,Rebel Pilot: Captain!  Scanners show the Tyranny deployed numerous sentry drones just before it left for Kuat - the Fresian system is locked down!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_22,Antilles: Blast!  We'd have the entire Imperial fleet in our laps before we could blink!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_23,C-3PO: Excuse me sir, but I believe Artoo could get the codes from the Imperial station uplink on Wayland to register your ships.  Then the Fresian sentries would clear you to the surface.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_24,Antilles: Not a bad plan, Threepio.  But you droids will never get there on your own.  You'll need a sizeable escort of ground troops to have any chance at all.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_25,DO NOT DISPLAY THIS TEXT: TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_25
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_26,Antilles: You can't come up with a plan and let someone else take all the credit, Threepio.  We can't attack Fresia if you and Artoo don’t get to the Imperial network on Wayland.  We're counting on you.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_27,C-3PO: Oh my!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_28,Antilles: The alarm will sound almost immediately, and reinforcements won’t be far behind.  We’ve got to cause enough damage to get the Tyranny back here!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_29,C-3PO: But, sir, I think my presence there won't be necessary… .
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_03,Rebel Pilot: The pilots are ready to go, sir.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_04,Antilles: With the sensors blind to our ships, we should be able to sneak right down to Fresia and grab those X-wings.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_05,Rebel Pilot: You sure the sensors are down?

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_26,Boba Fett: I'm tracking a ship that was reported in this area recently.  Anything suspicious to report?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_27,Imperial Officer: Nothing, aside from the usual pirate activity.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_28,Boba Fett: I'll take a look around just to make sure.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_48,Han Solo: We moved to far away - we lost the scan lock.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_03,Mon Mothma: We've been tracking the cargo container, and the Empire has finally delivered it to the station at Corulag.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_04,Mon Mothma: The EMP device we've planted will be discovered soon, so time is critical.  Hurry to Corulag and detonate the device.  With the station's defenses taken offline, we can move in and raid the facility for information.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_05,Antilles: We'll recover whatever data we can find and get to the bottom of this secret weapon once and for all!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_32,Antilles: It's borrowed time at best.  When they get moving again, we better not be around.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_33,Antilles: Boarding parties, get going.  Search the station and collect any data you can!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_34,Rebel Soldier: Yes, sir!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_35,Antilles: That EMP didn't last as long as we thought!  Protect the boarding party and take out any ship that reactivates!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_36,Mon Mothma: The Mon Calamari we rescued was in Tarkin's service for some time and has a wealth of information.  The name of this Imperial superweapon is the Death Star.  We can only assume its purpose follows its name.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_37,Antilles: Any word from our other contacts?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_38,Mon Mothma: Our friend within the Senate is following her leads as we speak.  She may be able to provide us detailed schematics of the Death Star, but will need a reliable captain for some errands that may put her at risk.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_39,Antilles: I'll transfer to her ship immediately.  Threepio, Artoo, come along.  We'll need you too.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_40,C-3PO: Of course, sir.  We're glad to be of service.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_41,Mon Mothma: Do be careful, the Empire grows bolder in its liberties with the Senate each day.  They may not respect any form of diplomatic immunity in their pursuit of our destruction.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_45,Antilles: The space station has been destroyed - along with our men.  We must retreat!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_04,Mon Mothma: My inquiries into this Imperial superweapon have put us in a dangerous situation.  A pirate associate of ours has gone rogue, offering to sell information on the Alliance to Imperial command.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_05,Antilles: That's what we get for dealing with those slimeballs.  Those pirates would sell their own mothers out for a few credits!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_06,Mon Mothma: He has arranged a meeting with the Imperials near Atzerri.  We must intercept that pirate before he can transfer the detailed information of our bases to the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_07,Antilles: The Empire will not get their hands on that data!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_08,Antilles: I said I'd take care of this, and I mean to be there to do so.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_09,Antilles: The Alliance is doomed if we don't recover that data from the pirates.  As soon as my ship is repaired, we must try again!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_11,Imperial Officer: The pirate is going after our Interdictors!  Stop him!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_13,Imperial Officer: We've lost one of our Interdictors!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_14,Antilles: Once those Interdictors are gone, the pirate will jump to lightspeed.  We can't let that happen!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_15,Antilles: There's only one Interdictor left!  We have to stop the pirate before it's destroyed!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_16,Antilles: One more to go and we can get out of here!  Concentrate on that last Interdictor!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_17,Imperial Officer: We've lost all our Interdictors!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_18,Antilles: The pirate can escape!  We've got to stop him!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_20,Imperial Officer: Multiple jump signatures inbound!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_23,Antilles: We've recovered the data!  Now let's get out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_24,Rebel Pilot: With those Interdictors on-line, we aren't going anywhere!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_25,Antilles: Then we have to take those things down so we can get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_26,Antilles: We've got the data!  Let's get out of here before the Empire brings in more ships!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_27,Antilles: The pirate has jumped out of the system!  We've lost him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_28,Imperial Officer: We have recovered the Rebel data!  Transmit it to Coruscant immediately!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_29,Antilles: No!  The Alliance is done for!  We should have moved faster!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_30,Antilles: The Empire is going after the pirate's ship!  We must get to it before they do!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_32,Mon Mothma: The data the pirate carried would have been damning to the Alliance's efforts and many systems would have been in jeopardy had it fallen into the Empire's hands.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_33,Mon Mothma: The captured pirate has divulged information he's gathered on this superweapon project.  Grand Moff Tarkin is overseeing that project personally.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_34,Mon Mothma: We know where Tarkin was conducting research, but we risk a frontal assault on a fortified Imperial station.  But there may be another way, and I think I know an experienced smuggler who can assist us... .
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_35,Han Solo: Well, well, if it isn't the Rebel Alliance!  Seeing as how you're all about helping people, how about lending me a hand?  I've got some unwanted Imperial attention… .
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_36,Mon Mothma: We will consider it payment for future services rendered.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_37,Han Solo: Payment?  Well, I... okay, okay!  Fine!  Deal!  Just get us out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_38,Antilles: Looks like we got here in time!  The Imperial fleet hasn't arrived yet!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_39,Antilles: Blast!  I spoke too soon.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_40,Imperial Officer: A Rebel fleet!  So much the better!  We will destroy them and get the data as well!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_41,Antilles: We're too late!  The pirate is heading right for the Empire's fleet!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_42,Imperial Officer: Attention pirate scum, surrender the data on the Alliance or be destroyed!  We will spare your life in return.  There will be no negotiations!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_43,Imperial Officer: The pirate is running!  Stop him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_44,Antilles: We've got to get to that pirate before the Empire does!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_48,Antilles: I need to get close to that pirate's starship to get what we need.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_49,Pirate: You may have found me, but it will do you no good.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_50,Pirate: The Rebellion is finished. You'll never get to me before I reach the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_51,Pirate: It's going to take more than a few Rebel ships to stop me.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_52,Pirate: Just another moment and the Empire will know all of the Alliance's secrets.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_53,Pirate: Take evasive action! All auxiliary power to the deflector shields!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_54,Pirate: We're taking heavy fire! This ship won't take much more!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_55,Rebel Pilot: We've spotted an Interdictor!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_56,Rebel Pilot: I've got visual lock on an Interdictor.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_57,Antilles: Keep searching, there's still more Interdictors in this sector.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_58,Antilles: Continue scanning. We have more Interdictors to deal with.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_03,Mon Mothma: The loss of Captain Solo is unfortunate.  We must try again to rescue him from the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_04,Imperial Officer: Smuggler scum!  We've got you now!  Prepare to be boarded!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_05,Han Solo: Now or never guys!  Get us out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_07,Han Solo: Sooner than later fellas!  This ship isn't indestructible!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_08,Han Solo: That did it!  Now let's get out of here while we're still in one piece!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_11,Han Solo: So about that payment in advance thing… .
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_12,Mon Mothma: We have a mission for you, Captain Solo.  Something that I feel is perfectly suited for someone with your particular… skills.  We have an errand for you to run to Vergesso.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_13,Han Solo: Vergesso, eh?  Imperial cargo depot.  What am I stealing?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_14,Mon Mothma: Not stealing - planting.  You're going to find a particular cargo container that is destined for an Imperial research facility, and place a device in it.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_15,Han Solo: This device wouldn't be of the explosive persuasion, would it?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_16,Mon Mothma: Let's just say you should be very careful.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_17,Han Solo: Don't worry.  I do this sort of thing all the time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_18,Mon Mothma: Han Solo must perform this task alone.  Too many ships would draw unwanted attention to the area.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_03,Mon Mothma: The data we recovered from Tarkin's research station has provided some information on the Death Star, but not enough technical detail to move against it.  I hope that our friend in the senate will turn up more.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_04,Mon Mothma: Before returning home, Ackbar told us that the development research on the Mon Calamari cruisers was annexed by the Empire and is being kept in a vault on Carida.  With this data, the Mon Calamari could build their massive capital ships, giving us a great advantage against Imperial Star Destroyers.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_05,Rebel Soldier: Han Solo has arrived, as you requested, Mon Mothma.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_06,Han Solo: Couldn't do without me, huh?  If you have a paying job, I have to warn you - my price has doubled.  The repairs on the Falcon almost broke me!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_07,Mon Mothma: I can assure you that your ship won't receive a scratch.  In truth, it won't even have to move.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_08,Han Solo: Wait a minute.  I wasn't born yesterday.  What's the catch?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_09,Mon Mothma: The best way to get you to Carida doesn't require your ship.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_10,Han Solo: Carida?  Shipyard?  Hey, wait!  You're not shipping us off like a couple of - Watch it!  Watch it!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_11,Mon Mothma: You should be very familiar with that system because of your days in the Academy, but it is exceedingly difficult to get landing clearances for Imperial deserters there.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_12,Rebel Soldier: The shuttle is ready to take the container to Carida.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_13,Mon Mothma: Good.  See that it arrives safely.  We want our smugglers in good shape.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_14,Mon Mothma: I have a task for our smuggler friend.  Send the word out that we are hiring, and for a substantial fee.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_15,Rebel Soldier: Right away!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_16,Mon Mothma: We've lost contact with Captain Solo and Chewbacca.  Their mission is vital - we must recover them and try again!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_17,Han Solo: How did I know she'd ask us to do this!  I know it's hot in here!  Try not to breathe so much!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_20,Han Solo: No amount of money is worth this!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_21,Han Solo: We're in the middle of an Imperial city - how are we ever going to find the schematics?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_22,Han Solo: Hmm… looks like that storage area is our best bet.  You said it Chewie - I've got a bad feeling about this too.  Looks like we'll have to be a bit creative in how we get over there… .
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_24,Han Solo: That should do it!  Now let's go get the ship schematics!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_25,Han Solo: Finally!  This looks like the right stuff to me.  Let's get it and get out of here!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_32,Han Solo: Ugh.  That's a bit too many to take head-on.  Let me shut 'em down before you move in, Chewie.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_34,Han Solo: Those troopers should be easy pickings with the right weapon… .
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_35,Han Solo: Wow.  That's a lot of firepower.  Those AT-STs will be a problem unless we can find something more powerful to use on 'em.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_36,Han Solo: Hey Chewie, Imperial tanks!  Why don't you take one for a drive?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_38,Han Solo: That wasn't so hard, was it?  I thought they'd put up more of a fight!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_39,Han Solo: That tower means business.  We need something to take it out at range… look around will ya?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_40,Han Solo: Hmm… that's got some range.  Chewie?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_41,Han Solo: There's no way we're getting close to the storage area with those active.  Let's look for a way to shut off the power.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_42,Han Solo: There she is!  We take that power generator off-line, and we'll be able to walk right past those turbolaser turrets.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_43,Han Solo: Weren't there some shuttles back a little ways?  I think it's time we borrowed one!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_05,Mon Mothma: You've certainly earned this.  The Mon Calamari will be able to restart their production facilities now.  The Alliance would be happy to discuss the possibility of a longer-term relationship if you'd like further work… .

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_08,Mon Mothma: We received an Imperial announcement that Princess Leia Organa's ship, the Tantive IV, was attacked by pirates.  The Empire has promised an investigation, but we are certain that is merely a cover.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_09,Mon Mothma: The Mon Calamari have thrown off Imperial control and attacked the Empire's fleets orbiting above them.  They have pledged their assistance to us and are using the schematics we recovered to rebuild their fleets.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_10,Mon Mothma: True to form, the Empire has wasted no time in assembling a fleet to retake the planet.  If they were to reach Mon Calamari, the devastation to the planet would be catastrophic. 
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_11,Mon Mothma: We have informants in place to alert us when the fleet gets underway.  We must not waste a moment in preparing for this assault.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_12,Rebel Pilot: The Imperial fleet is moving out from Coruscant!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_14,Rebel Pilot: How are we going to stop that fleet from rolling over all our defenses?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_15,Mon Mothma: Concentrate your defense efforts along the hyperspace routes to Mon Calamari.  Do whatever it takes to stop the fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_16,Rebel Pilot: The fleet is on approach to Mon Calamari!  It's now or never if we're going to stop them!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_17,Rebel Pilot: The Empire has retaken Mon Calamari!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_18,Mon Mothma: We must free the Mon Calamari from the Empire as soon as possible.  Every moment we waste, more and more of them will be slaughtered in retaliation for their actions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_20,Rebel Pilot: We've destroyed the fleet!  Mon Calamari is saved!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_21,Mon Mothma: Captain Antilles was piloting that ship, and I can only assume the worst.  He was a true hero and will be missed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_03,Mon Mothma: Our victory over the Empire's fleet is cause for celebration, but I find it disturbing that they appear almost unconcerned with the loss of ships and personnel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_04,Rebel Pilot: We decimated almost a quarter of their active fleet.  Rebuilding the ships alone will set them back years!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_05,Mon Mothma: Perhaps... they no longer need the ships.  I fear that the Alliance and all those that cherish freedom in the galaxy are in danger.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_06,Rebel Soldier: Alderaan has been destroyed!  Scouts report there's nothing left but debris!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_07,Mon Mothma: The Empire's plan is more unspeakable than we thought.  They intend to rule or destroy everything in the galaxy.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_08,Rebel Soldier: What can we do against that level of firepower?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_09,Mon Mothma: We must do what we can, and continue our fight against this tyranny.  I only hope that will be enough.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_10,Rebel Soldier: A Corellian freighter just arrived from the vicinity of Alderaan.  They claim to have the data on the Death Star with them.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_11,Han Solo: Freighter?  Freighter?!  I'll have you know she's much more than that, pal.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_12,Mon Mothma: It appears you are back in our fold yet again, Captain Solo.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_13,Han Solo: I tell you, if I had known all along what you were up to, I would have just let the Empire catch me on Carida.  I’m just here to drop off that Princess of yours, and those droids.  I'll take my reward and be off.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_14,Mon Mothma: We cannot force you to aid us, but know that if the Empire has its way, you will find no safe haven no matter where you run.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_15,Han Solo: I'll take my chances.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_16,Mon Mothma: General Dodonna's analysis of the Death Star plans provided by Princess Leia has provided us with what might be a weakness in its defenses, and I am afraid that we will soon be forced to put it to the test.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_17,Rebel Pilot: How can we hope to match the firepower of that station?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_18,Mon Mothma: We cannot match it directly, only try to exploit its weakness.  This is our most desperate hour.  Our fate lies in the hands of our daring pilots.  We must stop the Death Star before it destroys more worlds!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_19,Mon Mothma: It appears you have a conscience after all.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_20,Han Solo: Don't let that rumor get started - it would be bad for business.  I just couldn't leave without properly saying goodbye is all.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_22,Mon Mothma: An Imperial tracking device was found on Han Solo's ship.  It is obvious the Empire is on their way towards us at this very moment.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_00,Antilles: Our contacts inside Incom reporting in - we have a go for jump.  Repeat, we have go for jump!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_01,Antilles: Now listen up, keep it simple.  Get in, grab the X-wings, and get out.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_02,Rebel Pilot: Nothing's simple when you mess with the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_03,Antilles: We may encounter some light resistance, but the Incom nationalization ceremony isn't until tomorrow, so the Imperial fleet won't be there yet.  Trust me.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_08,Antilles: So, our intel was wrong.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_09,Rebel Pilot: What kind of ceremony calls for an Imperial Star Destroyer!?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_10,Antilles: That's some serious firepower - it appears we've underestimated the significance of this event.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_11,Rebel Pilot: How are we going to get to the X-wings now?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_12,Antilles: If one of the fleet was deployed for the celebration, then it's not at its normal station.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_14,Antilles: Not now, Threepio.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_19,Rebel Pilot: The shipyard then?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_20,Antilles: Yes.  I think we can get their attention….  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_21,Rebel Pilot: There’s no way we’re getting past that Star Destroyer.  You’d think the Fresians would have warned us.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_22,Antilles: It’s not their fault.  The nationalization wasn’t announced.  The Emperor likes his surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_23,Rebel Pilot: So what now?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_24,Antilles: If the Tyranny is here, then it’s not at its normal station…and the Tyranny is normally stationed at…

TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_INT_LOAD_COR43_01,Urai Fen: Ignore the outer defenses, rush the governor!
TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_INT_LOSS_COR43_04,Urai Fen: We're done playing with this governor. We're ready to return and deal him a blow he'll remember for the rest of his pitiful life.
TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_INT_TACTICAL_COR43_02,Urai Fen: Governor Koong Eeth has proven difficult. We aren't going to kill him, maiming him should accomplish our goal.
TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_INT_VICTORY_COR43_03,Urai Fen: Well done! The planet is corrupted. When the Governor recovers, he will be much more likely to do what we tell him. Tyber Zann's plans must not be hindered in any way. 
TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_RKT_VICTORY_COR43_05,Defiler: The Zann Consortium racketeering organization has planet wide influence on Saleucami. Our next step is to trick Rebel and Imperial forces to engage in the system so we can salvage their ships and gain from the battles.

TEXT_SPEECH_TARIS_INT_LOAD_COR46_01,Silri: Twitch is as quick in combat as I am powerful.
TEXT_SPEECH_TARIS_INT_LOSS_COR46_04,Silri: Who could know the duelist could shoot like that. I must go again.
TEXT_SPEECH_TARIS_INT_TACTICAL_COR46_02,Silri: I expect Twitch to be unusually resourceful. We will lose many units in this battle, only victory concerns me.
TEXT_SPEECH_TARIS_INT_VICTORY_COR46_03,Silri: Rumors of the damage we did to Twitch have spread across the world. The planet is secure. The Zann Consortium's plans proceed well.
TEXT_SPEECH_TATOOINE_BLK_VICTORY_COR47_02,Defiler: The Hutts know what they're doing when it comes to maintaining a Black Market. The Consortium's plans move quickly in this sector. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TATOOINE_BRB_VICTORY_COR47_01,Defiler: We now have the leaders of many Tusken Raiders in our pockets ready to help the plans of the Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TEST_EVENT,Welcome to the test Speech Event.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_LOAD_COR48_01,Tyber Zann: I won't tolerate mistakes in this effort. Get in, grab Ungarr, and get out.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_LOSS_COR48_04,Tyber Zann: I needed to use more experienced mercenaries in that raid. I'll regroup and try again. 
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_02,Tyber Zann: Ungarr Daris will have many security forces guarding him. Kill them and take him. 
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_06,Tyber Zann: Ungarr Daris, you're a very important man.  I'll give you a choice.  You can come with me and continue to be an important man, or you can die right here and now.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_07,Ungarr Daris: I don’t want any trouble, just don't hurt my family.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_08,Tyber Zann: As long as you or your family don't upset me, they'll be fine.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_VICTORY_COR48_03,Tyber Zann: With Ungarr in our control, many useful things can happen on the planet and in that sector of space. 
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_RKT_VICTORY_COR48_05,Defiler: Centering our racketeering efforts around Bacta production can bring the economic power of the planet under our control
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_01,Station Officer: An Imperial peace-keeping envoy deployed to Kashyyyk was assaulted by an unusually organized dissident group.  This warrants our full attention.  I am sending you to investigate a derelict space station being used as a haven by these… Rebels.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_02,Station Officer: Direct this space fleet to Kashyyyk and reinforce the Imperial units already en route. Eliminate all resistance, and report back to me at once.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_04,Hint: To attack the Rebel space forces located above Kashyyyk, drag the Imperial fleet from Nal Hutta to Kashyyyk.  Moving a fleet into orbit above an enemy planet will initiate a space battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_06,Hint: To take control of the space above Kashyyyk, you will need to eliminate all of the enemy forces and base structures. You will be escorted by an Imperial officer on this mission. This officer will provide you strategic advice from the safety of his shuttle craft.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_07,Shuttle Officer: Welcome to the front line.  We've pinpointed their base of operations and are standing by.  Our orders are to eliminate this station by any means necessary.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_08,Hint: Double-click on any unit to select all visible units of that same type.  Smaller units, such as fighter squadrons, can be selected by clicking on either the squadron icon or on the individual units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_09,Hint: Your units can be assigned to control groups.  Select all units to be added to a control group, and then press the CTRL button and a number key.  Pressing the assigned number key again will select all units within the control group.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_10,Shuttle Officer: We will need to navigate through this hazardous terrain to reach our destination.  Stay away from the asteroid fields, and stay alert.  This area is ripe for an ambush, and we can’t afford to take any losses!  Follow me.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_12,Hint: Asteroid fields damage larger units over a period of time.  If a large ship travels through an asteroid field it may become heavily damaged or destroyed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_13,Shuttle Officer: Incoming hostiles!  Remember your training!  Divert power to weapons!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_15,Hint: When using fighter units to attack enemy fighter or bomber squadrons, they will engage in a dogfight.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_16,Hint: Use the Tartan Cruiser's Power to Weapons ability to increase the ship's rate of fire and destroy the fighter squadrons blocking your path.  Select your Tartan Cruiser units, then click on the Power to Weapons ability icon, located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_17,Shuttle Officer: Good job.  Watch out for those nebula fields.  They'll wreak havoc on our auxiliary systems.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_19,Hint: Nebula Fields are swirling clouds of gas and dust that can be found in space.  These fields do not damage ships, but they do disable the use of unit abilities, such as the Power to Weapons ability.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_20,Shuttle Officer: Incoming hostiles!  Open fire!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_21,Shuttle Officer: Imperial scouts reported a frigate ship along with a bomber squadron in the vicinity.  Take a moment to allow our shields to regenerate before advancing.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_22,Hint: Shield status is reflected by a blue bar on a ship's health meter.  Shields regenerate over time for most space units.  Hull status is reflected by a green meter.  Unlike shield damage, hull damage does not regenerate over time.  If a ship’s hull is destroyed, the ship will be destroyed.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_23,Shuttle Officer: Okay, let’s move out… follow me.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_24,Shuttle Officer: There they are!   The frigate has been damaged, probably by one of our patrols.  If those bombers manage to attack us first, their torpedoes will tear our hulls apart.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_26,Hint: Units with torpedo projectiles, such as bombers, are able to bypass shields on all ships and structures.  This makes them extremely dangerous.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_28,Shuttle Officer: Good work.  That damaged frigate lies between us and the Rebel station.  Even wounded, it poses a threat.  As we approach we will need to intercept any Rebel fighter squadrons with our scouts, and direct all other units to attack the frigate.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_29,Hint: Destroy the hard-points on larger ships and space stations to disable critical parts like weapons, shields, and engines.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_30,Hint: Only units with torpedo projectiles (such as bombers) can attack hard-points on a ship or structure while the shields are functioning.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_31,Acclamator Pilot: Assault fleet, this is Imperial Acclamator oh-one-niner.  We are en-route to reinforce your position and are awaiting your coordinates.  Confirm.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_32,Shuttle Officer: Good!  We will need reinforcements to commence with our assault.  Deploy our reinforcement ships and bring more firepower to bear against that space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_34,Hint: To bring reinforcements into a battle, select the reinforcement button, then drag and release the ships into space from the reinforcement window.  Remember - reinforcements can only be released in open space, away from enemy structures and other hazards. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_35,Shuttle Officer: Watch out for those ion fields!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_36,Hint: Ion Fields are swirling clouds of charged gas and dust that can be found in space.  These fields do not damage ships, but they do disable unit abilities and shield regeneration.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_37,Shuttle Officer: Be careful.  This doesn’t look like the work of space rabble… the shields on that derelict space station have been restored.  Approach the station with Fighter Squadrons to draw its fire, and use other units to eliminate the remaining hard-points.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_39,Hint: Small fighters are useful against space stations because of their speed and small size.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_40,Hint: Destroy the shield generator hard-point for enemy ships and space stations to disable their ability to regenerate shields.  This will make them more vulnerable to attack, and easier to destroy.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_41,Shuttle Officer: Excellent work!  Let’s return to base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_43,Hint: Broadside Cruiser ships are long range units that are strong against space stations.  In addition, these ships have the Barrage ability.  To use this ability: select a Broadside Cruiser unit, click on the Barrage ability icon, and then target enemy units or structures using the left-mouse-button.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_54,Hint: Select your units by left-clicking on them, and then issue a move command by right-clicking on the desired map location.  Scroll the tactical display by moving your cursor to the edge of the screen, or by using the keyboard arrow keys.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_55,Hint: Select your units by left-clicking on them, and then issue an attack command by right-clicking on enemy units.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_56,Hint: Before you can complete your training, you must also learn how to command space forces in battle.  Let's examine another conflict, this time from the perspective of the Empire.  In this case, the Empire faction is attempting to eliminate a Rebel space station located in orbit above Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_57,Hint: Acclamator ships contain TIE fighters and TIE bombers, as well as the Power to Weapons ability to help you destroy the Rebel space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_58,Hint: To view this battle from a cinematic perspective - select the cinematic camera option, located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_01,Station Officer: Hmph…  It appears the Rebels we encountered on Kashyyyk have fled the system.  Clearly, this petty Rebellion is far less organized than I had originally thought.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_02,Station Officer: Take these forces, capture Kashyyyk, and report back to me immediately.  Considering that there is absolutely no resistance on Kashyyyk, even you should have no problem with this simple task.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_04,Hint:  To move a fleet across the galaxy, drag the fleet icon to the space slot above a planet.  Once your fleet is in orbit above Kashyyyk you can then drag them to the surface of the planet to capture it. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_05,Hint: Capturing Kashyyyk has increased the total number of units that you can build, as well as the number of credits that you collect at the end of every Galactic Day.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_06,Station Officer: Excellent…
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_07,Hint: A trade route now connects Kashyyyk and Nal Hutta, increasing the total number of credits generated by the connected planets.  Trade routes also increase the movement speed of any friendly fleets traveling along their path.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_08,Station Officer: Now that we control Kashyyyk we can use our newfound credits to improve our assets on Nal Hutta.  See to it, at once…
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_10,Hint:  Upgrading your space station will make it a stronger defensive structure, and will also allow you to support more units.  Switch to space production mode by selecting the space production tab.  Then, build a Space Station by clicking on the Space Station icon.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_11,Station Officer: Unlike those vile Rebels, we do not poach technology from others, nor do we kidnap scientists.  Construct a Research Facility, and begin research on technology level 2.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_14,Hint: Unlike the Rebels, all Empire-based technology is dependent upon the presence of base structures, known as Research Facilities.  Switch to land production mode by selecting the land production tab.  Then, build a Research Facility by clicking on the Research Facility icon.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_20,Station Officer: Apparently, a Moff on Coruscant has detected an anomaly within our quarterly reserve reports.  Considering that I personally oversee all of your credit transactions, there can only be one explanation: there is a smuggler in our midst!  Direct a Bounty Hunter from the local Hutt Palace to eliminate the smuggler on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_22,Hint: Whenever the total credit value of a planet is modified it will be visible at the planet itself.  In this case, the credits generated at Nal Hutta have been reduced by the presence of an enemy smuggler.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_23,Station Officer: The captured smuggler has proven to be… uncooperative.  Regardless, his ship logs reveal he could only have originated from a nearby system.  Deploy as many Probe Droids as needed to locate his employers!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_25,Hint: In order to receive information on nearby enemy systems, the Empire must use Probe Droids.  Whenever Probe Droids are deployed to the surface of a planet, information about that planet will be revealed to the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_26,Station Officer: Failure is unacceptable.  Keep searching…
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_27,Hint: Probe Droids serve as disposable spy units for the Empire.  Unlike the Rebel Alliance, the Empire does not receive information about nearby enemy planets.  Gather more information about nearby enemy planets, by deploying Imperial Probe Droids to the ground slot of each planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_28,Station Officer: We will extend the search radius to other, nearby planets.  Find them - do not fail me again!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_29,Station Officer: Unbelievable!  More dissidents?!  Prepare our forces; we must stamp out this new uprising immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_30,Station Officer: If we are to succeed in our assault we will need to employ a strategy of my own making… one that requires both skill and cunning… one that will assure us a victory with minimal risk…
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_31,Station Officer: We will direct our Acclamator ships to unleash their bomber squadrons upon the Rebels until they submit, and then - when they march, arms-raised, from their pitiful, smoldering base we will bomb them again!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_33,Hint: Most Imperial ships, such as Acclamator ships, contain bomber units.  Whenever bomber units are positioned in orbit above an enemy planet, bombing run attacks may be used while you are involved in a land battle at that planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_34,Station Officer: To ensure a certain level of… competence on this mission, I require a senior officer to accompany you.  Recruit a Field Commander from the Officer Academy on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_36,Hint: Field Commanders provide combat bonuses to all friendly units within a battle.  You must have access to an Officer Academy in order to recruit a Field Commander.  Switch to land production mode by selecting the land production tab.  Then, build a Officer Academy and Field Commander by clicking on the appropriate icons.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_37,Station Officer: Excellent, now consolidate the land and space fleets on Nal Hutta, so that we may commence with the assault.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_41,Hint: To initiate a Land Tactical battle, drag the fleet into the land slot on Ryloth.  Remember - while you have bomber units in orbit above the planet you will also have access to Bombing Runs.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_43,Hint: You may issue production commands while the game is paused for an impending battle.  Galactic production will resume once all battles have been resolved.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_44,Station Officer: Yes… good!  All of the necessary components are finally in place. The Rebels won't know what hit them.  Ryloth will be mine!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_45,Hint:  Larger ships, like Acclamators, have a significant impact towards the maximum unit capacity provided by planets and space stations. Once that limit is reached, you cannot create new units until more planets are acquired
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_63,Hint: Bounty Hunters are spy units that can be used to neutralize enemy hero units.  A Bounty Hunter is available on Nal Hutta because a Hutt Palace is present on this planet.  To Neutralize the enemy Smuggler, drag the Bounty Hunter to the Neutralize Hero slot located on Nal Hutta, and then select the unit to be neutralized.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_64,Hint: Since there are no Rebel forces on Kashyyyk, the Empire can capture the planet without entering into a land battle.  Whenever you capture a planet, you will be rewarded with credits, as well as the ability to support more units.  The more planets that you capture, the larger your forces can become.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_65,Hint: Upgrading your technology level will provide you with access to new units, structures, and upgrades.  Switch to land production mode by selecting the land production tab.  Then, upgrade your technology level by clicking on the Upgrade Technology icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_70,Hint: You have found Pirates.  While they are hostile to the Empire, these aren't the Rebels you're looking for.    Gather more information about nearby enemy planets, by deploying Imperial Probe Droids to the ground slot of each planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_01,Field Commander: This clearing is suitable for use as a Reinforcement Point.  Secure the area, and deploy our scouts.  We’ll launch the assault from this position.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_03,Hint: The area surrounding a Reinforcement Point must be clear of enemies before it may be captured.  Remember - you can use Build Pads to purchase defensive structures in strategic areas, such as this Reinforcement Point.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_05,Hint: Land reinforcements can only be deployed in controlled areas, known as Reinforcement Points.  Conquering Reinforcement Points is of particular strategic importance in this game.  The amount of units you can bring into any Reinforcement Point is determined by that Point's capacity, denoted by the number shown.  Once you reach that capacity, you can no longer land units at that particular Reinforcement Point.  You will have to conquer another Reinforcement Point to bring down more units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_06,Field Commander: A sandstorm!  It will, no doubt, prove to be a nuisance - but it will not stop us from achieving victory!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_07,Hint: Foul weather can reduce the effectiveness of your units.  You must account for weather changes whenever you are engaged in battle on a planet's surface.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_08,Field Commander: The locals are supporting the Rebel forces on this system.  Eliminate them - we cannot afford to lose control of the Reinforcement Point!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_10,Hint: When invading the surface of a planet, it is vital you maintain control of as many Reinforcement Points as possible since you can only deploy reinforcements near areas that you control.  If the defender gains control of a Reinforcement Point, you will not be able to deploy reinforcements at that location.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_11,Field Commander: Good work!  They’ll think twice before interfering in Imperial affairs. Now, about that Rebel base…
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_12,Field Commander: The Rebels apparently have a Base Shield Generator.  Clever, but it won’t stop us for long - locate the Power Generator supplying power to that shield, and destroy it!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_14,Hint: Base Shield Generators provide the defender with a significant advantage by blocking enemy blaster fire and reducing the movement speed of enemy units.  Base Shield Generators require Power Generators in order to function.  This means that if you destroy the Power Generator, the Base Shield will be disabled.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_15,Hint: Since bombing-capable units are in orbit above this system, Bombing Runs are available for use in this battle.  Select the Bombing Run icon on the command bar, and then target a visible area to bomb by left-clicking on the battlefield.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_16,Field Commander: The Base Shield Generator is down!  All units - attack the Rebel base!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_18,Hint: Use your forces and special abilities, such as bombing runs, to destroy enemy turrets, buildings, and other base defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_19,Station Officer: Good… very good!  Not only has the Rebel base been destroyed, but we now control all of the resources provided by Ryloth.  Grand Moff Tarkin will be pleased to hear of my success!  You are dismissed…
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_26,Hint: Imperial forces have detected the Rebel presence here on the surface of Kashyyyk.  You will need to gather your troops and attack the Alliance base on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_27,Hint: To accomplish this, you must make use of the units and special abilities that have been brought to this planet.  Eliminate all enemy units and structures to gain control of the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_28,Hint: Beware of indigenous units, such as Jawas.  These forces will continue to attack until their habitat has been destroyed.  Use your forces to destroy the Jawa Sandcrawler.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_37,Hint:  Darth Vader will accompany you on this mission so that he may investigate the Rebel presence on Ryloth personally.  Hero units, including Darth Vader, are special units that can be used to turn the tide of even the most difficult battles.  Use Darth Vader's special abilities to ensure victory on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_42,Hint: During the course of a battle you will occassionally encounter structures, such as this abandonded mining facility.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_39,Hint: As the defender you have access to garrisoned units.  These units are found by selecting certain structures in the Rebel base. They can be used to replenish lost forces.  Check the Rebel base for any garrisoned units which may become available.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_40,Base Dispatch: Incoming walkers!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_41,Patrol Leader: All PLEX Soldiers, attack!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_42,Hint: Every unit has strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited to win battles.  PLEX Rocket Soldiers are strong against lightly armored units, like these AT-ST walkers.  Command your PLEX Soldiers to attack the AT-ST units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_43,Base Dispatch: The base is secure!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_44,Patrol Leader: We need to reclaim all Reinforcement Points to our east.  Otherwise, the Imperials will continue to attack our position.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_50,Hint: Capturing the Reinforcement points will prevent the enemy from landing even more troops.  To capture a Reinforcement Point, you must eliminate all enemy units in the area and remain near the Reinforcement point until it turns green.  Note that every Reinforcement Point has a limit to how many units it can accommodate, denoted by the number shown.  In Tutorial 5, we'll give you the opportunity to bring reinforcements into a land battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_51,Hint: Remember, garrisoned units can be used to replenish lost forces.  Don’t forget to check the Rebel base for any Garrisoned units that may become available.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_55,Patrol Leader: Area secure!  Let’s keep moving!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_56,Patrol Leader: Area secure!  That’s all of them!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_57,Base Dispatch: Sir, I’m receiving reports that a massive Imperial Fleet is en route to Kashyyyk!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_58,Patrol Leader: This system is no longer secure.  We need to evacuate this base immediately.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_60,Hint: Retreating allows you to save your units from certain destruction whenever you are faced with overwhelming odds.  Remember - you can always return to a battle later with additional units.  Select the retreat button on your command bar to take your remaining forces and regroup them on another planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_61,Patrol Leader: Inform the main Alliance fleet that the Empire is aware of our presence on Kashyyyk.  The rest of you - prepare for evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_62,Rebel Soldier: Yes, sir!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_63,Hint: While the retreat timer is active, your units are more vulnerable to enemy attacks.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_64,Patrol Leader: I can only hope that the Imperials haven’t uncovered any other Alliance outposts.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_78,Hint: Imperial forces have detected the Rebel presence here on the surface of Kashyyyk.  You will need to gather your troops and defend the Alliance base on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_79,Hint: To accomplish this, you must command ground units, like these Rebel Soldiers who are currently on patrol, to eliminate the enemy invaders; but before you begin, it is critical that you also understand how to use the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_80,Hint: To view the entire battlefield, use the mini-map located in the bottom left corner of the screen.  Friendly units on the mini-map are displayed in green, while enemy units are red.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_01,Hint: Since you have successfully retreated from Kashyyyk you can continue to command the surviving forces from that battle within the Galactic View.  This view allows you to manage the resources on all of your planets, including your economy, bases, and units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_02,Patrol Leader: We need to evacuate Kashyyyk and reinforce the main Alliance fleet at Bothawui.  Prepare for departure by moving our ground forces into orbit above Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_04,Hint: Units within the Galactic View are represented by stacks of units, known as Fleets.  The strongest unit within a Fleet is always displayed on top.  Move these ground forces into orbit by dragging them from the surface of Kashyyyk into one of the available slots located above the planet.  This will prepare them for space travel.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_05,Patrol Leader: Good work.  I’ll transmit the system coordinates for Bothawui to you now… stand by.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_06,Hint: To access a more detailed view of a selected planet, click on the zoom-in icon, located on the Mini-Map.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_07,Patrol Leader: There it is… direct all fleets located on Kashyyyk to move to Bothawui.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_10,Hint: Mission objectives in Galactic Mode can be reviewed at any time by selecting the Mission Holocron option, located on the Command Bar.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_108,Hint: To obtain more resources, it will be necessary for you to claim another planet.  Capturing a planet will increase the total number of credits that you collect at the end of every Galactic Day.  It will also increase the total number of units that you can support.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_109,Hint: Ryloth is currently unoccupied.  This means that it should be an easy planet to capture.  Begin the process of capturing Ryloth by moving your forces into orbit above Ryloth.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_11,Patrol Leader: The main Alliance fleet should be within sight once we arrive.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_110,Hint: Your forces must occupy the surface of a planet in order to capture it.  To do this, simply move your fleet into the ground slot located near the center of the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_115,Hint: Let's take a closer look at Ryloth.  To access a more detailed view of a planet, select the planet, and then click on the Zoom-In icon, located on the Mini-Map.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_15,Patrol Leader: Reporting for duty!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_16,Mon Mothma: Welcome.  I am relieved to see that you survived the Empire's assault on Kashyyyk, but our situation is still dire.  You are all that remains of the forces there, and we have no other resources to draw upon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_17,Mon Mothma: As you can see, the Rebel Alliance currently controls Bothawui.  The Bothawui system is providing us with a modest credit supply, but if we are to withstand another attack from the Empire, we will need to find additional sources of income.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_18,Hint: Whenever a system is captured it provides a one-time credit bonus, and increases the rate which you accumulate credits.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_19,Mon Mothma: There are a small number of nearby systems which may serve as suitable candidates.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_20,Mon Mothma: Unlike the Empire, we do not prey on other systems to support our cause.  Instead, we prefer to acquire the bulk of our tactical resources in a way that undermines the Empire itself.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_21,Mon Mothma: Fortunately for us, our spy network provides us with the advantage of being completely aware of all Empire-controlled systems within the immediate area.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_22,Hint: Friendly systems are green, enemy systems are red, pirate systems are yellow, and neutral systems are gray.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_23,Mon Mothma: A smuggler on Bothawui has agreed to support our cause, and can be deployed to Nal Hutta.  Direct our smuggler to siphon credits from Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_24,Siphon Credits from Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_24A,Hint: A smuggler is available on Bothawui because a Cantina is present on this system.  If this Cantina was ever destroyed, it would need to be rebuilt before this smuggler could become available again.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_25,Mon Mothma: Good.  As long as our smuggler is deployed at Nal Hutta, we can expect to see an increase in our credit reserves.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_26,Mon Mothma: With this new source of income, we should now have ample resources to assemble several fleets.  First, we will need some additional infantry units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_28,Hint: Once a land unit has completed production, it will appear within the first available ground force position on the planet.  If no ground force positions are available, the unit will be added to the first available space fleet position, above the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_29,Mon Mothma: Good.  We will also need several space units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_31,Hint: Once a space unit has completed production, it will appear within the first empty space fleet position, above the planet.  If no empty fleet positions are available, the unit will be combined into the first available space fleet instead.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_32,Mon Mothma: Excellent.  However, we will also need access to more advanced units if we expect to defeat the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_33,Mon Mothma: We have built all that we can with our current resources.  Since we acquire our resources in ways that undermine the Empire, we will need to steal technology advancements from the Imperials.  These droids should be able to assist you in this task.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_35,Hint: The Rebel Alliance gains new technology by stealing it directly from Imperial planets.  Move R2-D2 and C-3PO to the Steal slot on Nal Hutta to steal technology from the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_36,Mon Mothma: Good.  We must also improve our hold on Bothawui by constructing defensive structures.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_38,Hint: A Power Generator will be built automatically for any structures that require power to function, including Base Shield Generators.  Remember - you can zoom-in on a planet to see any units and structures that you may have built.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_39,Mon Mothma: Now that our defenses are in place we should take steps to reinforce the neighboring planet of Tatooine.  Unfortunately, the space above Tatooine has been blockaded by an Imperial fleet, so we will need to make use of a Raid fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_40,Mon Mothma: Unlike normal fleets, Raid fleets do not initiate space combat on enemy systems.  Using Raid fleets allow us to reinforce or assault systems which are blockaded by enemy fleets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_41,Hint: The Rebel Alliance can use Raid Fleets to bypass space battles within enemy territory by moving directly to a planet's surface.  This allows the Rebel Alliance to reinforce friendly planets blocked by enemy space units, or even capture undefended enemy planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_42,Mon Mothma: Create a Raid fleet using some of our newly-recruited infantry, and reinforce the defenses on Tatooine.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_44,Hint:  Create a Raid Fleet by dragging a small number of infantry units into a space slot above Bothawui, so that they can then be moved into the Raid slot located on Tatooine.  This will allow these infantry units to bypass the Empire forces in space above Tatooine, and land directly on the planet's surface.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_45,Mon Mothma: Well done.  The additional support at Tatooine should allow our forces there to endure any sudden Imperial attacks.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_46,Mon Mothma: It appears Imperial forces are assaulting Kashyyyk sooner than I had anticipated.  I sincerely hope that our efforts to bolster these systems will suffice.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_48,Hint: he zoomed-in view allows you to review the contents and statistics for each planet.  Within this view you can manage your fleet contents, examine current planetary structures, view space station level or even sell ground base structures that are no longer needed on that planet.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_49,Hint: To manage fleets within this view, simply drag and drop the units to a location.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_50,Hint: Create a raid fleet by dragging the ground units shown here into orbit.  To move a unit into orbit, simply drag and drop the units to the desired fleet position.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_53,Hint: You will now need to bypass the Empire space units positioned above Tatooine.  To do this, simply drag the Rebel Raid Fleet from Bothawui to the Raid slot located on Tatooine.  This will place the infantry units directly on the surface of Tatooine.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_54,Hint: Hover the mouse cursor over any item that you wish to receive detailed information for and a tool-tip will be displayed.  Choose a technology to steal from the Empire by selecting it from the available list.  Whenever the Rebel faction exhausts all possible technology options, they will advance to the next technology level.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_68,Hint: Combining two fleets will create a single fleet that is larger and more powerful.  To combine your fleets, simply drag and drop one fleet icon onto another.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_69,Hint: Smugglers are spy units that can be used to increase your credit supply, without the need to capture planets.  A Smuggler is available on Bothawui because a Cantina is present on this planet.  To Steal Credits from the Empire drag the Smuggler unit to the Steal Credits slot on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_70,Hint: You will need to create ground forces in order to defend the surface of the planet.  Since you have built a barracks you now have the ability to create more ground units.  Switch to ground production mode by selecting the ground production tab.  Then, recruit two Rebel Infantry squads by clicking twice on the Rebel Infantry icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_71,Hint:  You will also need to create a space fleet in order to protect the space around the planet.  Now that you have created a fully operational space station, you have the ability to build ships. Switch to space production mode by selecting the space production tab.  Then, build two X-Wing Fighter squadrons by clicking twice on the X-Wing Fighter icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_72,Hint: You will need to build a Barracks before you can recruit infantry.  Building a Barracks will provide you with basic ground defenses, as well as the ability to recruit infantry units.  Switch to ground production mode by selecting the ground production tab.  Then, build a Barracks by clicking on the Barracks icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_73,Hint: To zoom-out from a system, click on the zoom icon, located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_74,Hint: Smugglers can provide additional income that can be useful whenever you are unable to capture enemy planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_79,Hint: You will need to build a Space Station before you can build space units.  Building a Space Station will provide you with basic space defenses, as well as the ability to build space units.  Switch to space production mode by selecting the space production tab.  Then, build a Space Station by clicking on the Space Station icon. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_80,Hint: Constructing multiple buildings of the same type on a planet will give you bonuses, such as faster build times for specific units, but remember - each planet has a limited capacity for structures.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_81,Hint: Every planet within the Star Wars galaxy is unique - possessing distinct terrain features, weather patterns, indigenous life, bonuses, and other attributes.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_82,Hint: Tool-tips are present for all planets, structures, units, fleets, and buttons.  Hover your mouse cursor over any item in the game that you wish to receive more detailed information for, and a tool-tip will be displayed.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_83,Hint: Whenever you capture a planet, you will be rewarded with credits.  Credits can be used to purchase new units, structures, and upgrades.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_84,Hint: You will receive money from all of the planets under your control at the end of each Galactic Day.  The more planets that you control, the more credits you will receive.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_91,Hint: Whenever a ground base structure has been built, it will become visible within this view.  Building base structures will increase your ground base level.  There are a limited number of land slots available to build upon, so you must choose wisely when building your base.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_92,Hint: Whenever a space station has been built, it will become visible within this view.  Unlike ground bases, space station levels can only be increased by upgrading the space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_93,Hint: Whenever a unit has been created, it will become visible within this view.  The number of units that you can support is limited, so you must choose wisely when constructing your fleets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_00,Tyber Zann: We have concealed ourselves in a small asteroid belt near our destination.  One of our advantages is that the Zann Consortium ships possess the ability to hide in asteroid fields indefinitely without taking any damage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_01,Tyber Zann: We are here to corrupt Mandalore, not conquer it.  Corrupting planets will increase our notoriety throughout the galaxy, and allow us to further the interests of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_02,Tyber Zann: We will need to hijack the Supreme Strategist's ship in order to spread corruption to Mandalore. This will allow us to intimidate the Mandalorians and offer them Protection from further pirate activities. Our objective will be approaching shortly enroute to the Hutt asteroid base orbiting Mandalore.  He has set up a perimeter of V-wings to prepare for his arrival. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_03,Tyber Zann: Those V-wing fighters should be no match for our fighters, which are equipped with Buzz Droids.  Use our fighters' Buzz Droid special ability to clear out the V-wings before the Supreme Strategist arrives.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_04,Tyber Zann: Good.  Now we will ambush the Supreme Strategist when he arrives, and show the galaxy that the Zann Consortium is a force to be reckoned with.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_05,Tyber Zann: There he is!  Hijack his ship by destroying his engines and bringing the boarding shuttle near his ship
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_06,Tyber Zann: Well done. We've now established a base for piracy on Mandalore.  This corruption sets up the Zann Consortium for our black market efforts on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_07,Supreme Strategist: It's an ambush!  All hands to battle stations!  We'll teach these pirate scum to stay clear of Mandalore!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_00,Zann Consortium Soldier: We've located a small clearing near the Hutt Cartel's landing party.  The landing area should have enough cover to hide our forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_01,Tyber Zann: Excellent.  Ensure that we are not detected by the Hutt forces on the ground.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_02,Tyber Zann: Alpha squad, scout the area and make certain our path is clear.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_03,Tyber Zann: Looks like our ship will be a little lighter for the return trip.  Apparently, some of the local foliage isn't safe for infantry.  Bring out the transport!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_04,Tyber Zann:  I can garrison my troops inside the transport and protect them from those poisonous plants.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_05,Hint: Select your troops and right click on the transport to garrison the selected units within it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_06,Tyber Zann: When everyone's inside the transport, we'll go to retrieve that artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_07,Tyber Zann: Blast it! The path ahead is traversable only with infantry.  Everyone out!  We'll need to go the rest of the way on foot.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_08,Tyber Zann: We're no match for those Anti-Infantry turrets.  Urai, we'll have to use our cloaking fields and sneak the rest of the way to the Hutt landing site.  We need to make sure we get there before our cloaking fields run out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_09,Hutt Mercenary: This place creeps me out.  I wish Jabba would…
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_10,Hutt Soldier: Look out!  It's Urai Fen!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_11,Urai Fen: The artifact is ours! What is the next step?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_12,Tyber Zann: Get those troops back to cover!  Urai and I must go alone from here on.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_13,Tyber Zann: We need to protect our landing site from anyone who might stumble across it.  Get out the MDUs and deploy them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_14,Hint: Deploy a Mobile Defense Unit, or MDU, by clicking on its 'Deploy' button, then Left-Click on the unit to access its build menu.  From there, you can choose what to build on top of the MDU.  The MDU cannot move again until the object on top is sold or destroyed and the unit is undeployed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_15,Hint: To eject units from a transport or garrisoned structure, select the transport or garrison and Right-Click it to eject all troops.  While the transport or garrison is selected, you can also click on the unit's icon from the selection menu to eject that unit from the garrison.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_16,Hint: The MDU needs to remain at the landing area to protect the transport from attackers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_17,Hint: Your infantry units will be severely injured if they progress into the poisonous flowers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_18,Urai Fen: They'll be coming for us at Ryloth once they learn that Tyber doesn't have their precious artifact.  Kamino is an ideal location to lay low while we plan Tyber's escape.  I have connections on Kamino that I trust to hide us for a while.  Build a suitable force and conquer Kamino.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_19,Tyber Zann: Those guard towers will see right through our cloaking fields.  If we try to go that way, we'll get chewed up by the anti-infantry turrets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_00,Hint: The Zann Consortium uses corruption powers, among other abilities, to gain advantages over the Empire and the Rebels. Pay close attention as you move Tyber Zann through the galaxy, corrupting planets to gain power.  In this scenario, Tyber will direct his Defiler units to corrupt Mandalore, and establish a Black Market on Nal Hutta, without actually conquering either planet. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_01,Tyber Zann: A year ago, I joined forces with Jabba the Hutt. Our combined criminal contacts and resources brought both of us great wealth. But I never intended to make this alliance permanent. Recently, Jabba acquired a unique artifact. From what I can tell, it cost him nearly half his wealth. It's too valuable a prize to let my good partner enjoy all by himself. That artifact will be in my hands soon. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_02,Tyber Zann: I'm going to go to Nal Hutta. There are Hutt family members that I intend to bribe so that I find out facts about Jabba and where the closest black market can be found. The black markets throughout the galaxy are important sources of stolen technology. As soon as the Empire or the Rebel Alliance develop new tech, it's available on the Black Market.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_03,Hint: Drag Tyber Zann to the glowing oval above Nal Hutta. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_04,Tyber Zann: Most worlds are alike. There are important officials on the planet who need credits for one reason or another. The trick is to find them, pay them, and keep them happy. Once you do this there is a rippling effect that spreads corruption and loyalty to me around the world. This time I go down and find one of the members of Jabba's family. He's one of  the many who doesn't like his cousin and wants to help my cause. I've dealt with him in the past and know his type of criminal well. It won't be easy to find him, the best acts of corruption are never without a little effort. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_05,Hint: Take Tyber and explore the landscape. Move past the characters and units you discover on the world. Sometimes these characters will attack and other times they'll ignore you completely. When you are near enough to your mark they will start up a conversation. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_06,Hut-tina, Jabba's fourth cousin: Tyber Zann it has been too long  since we last spoke. I think that drug ring we set up on the outer moons is still running well. What are you and that miserable cousin of mine doing these days?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_07,Tyber Zann: Never mind the pleasant conversation, Hut-tina. I've got credits for information. I know you helped Jabba hide his new treasure on Felucia. Tell me where it is and I will give you the credits. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_08,Hut-tina: It's really not that easy. First you must deal with the Black Market on Kashyyyk. Once you have the Buzz Droids you'll find there, you must go to Felucia. Jabba's hidden base is there, but don't take a lot of tanks. It's hidden where only your foot troops can go. The Buzz Droids are a vital key toward the success of your mission.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_09,Hint: Tyber summons a Defiler to deal with the Black Market on Nal Hutta. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_10,Hint: To see the cost of bribing your way to a planet, drag your force to your final destination without releasing the mouse button.  The bribe cost will be listed next to your fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_100,Hint: Buzz droids will swarm an enemy unit and begin tearing through its hull. Activate this ability by selecting the highlighted button and targeting an area near your desired target.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_101,Hint: Note that Urai Fen has the innate ability to self heal.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_102,Hint: The Zann Consortium can either corrupt or capture planets, the choice is yours.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_103,Hint: Like the original Empire at War, conquering establishes ownership and allows Tyber to build new bases. Corrupting an enemy planet leaves the enemy in control, but in return Tyber gains access to unique missions, tech upgrades, enemy information, increased income, and new space routes.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_11,Tyber Zann: My plans grow apace. As soon as the agents on Nal Hutta are contacted, I can tap into their Black Market community. It's a source of valuable stolen technology. Now that I know about Black Market on Nal Hutta, I can send a Defiler to establish communications with it. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_12,Hint: Drag a Defiler to the 'Spread Corruption' slot at the planet Nal Hutta. Once there, use the Defiler to tap into the Black Market on Nal Hutta. There will be chances to contact and gain technology from scientifically rich worlds all over the galaxy. Once you have set up your connections with the Black Market, the world will be corrupted, and will serve your cause. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_13,Tyber Zann: Nal Hutta is crawling with Imperial units, so we need to bribe the system officials there to let us fly by unnoticed.  We're going to raid Jabba's hidden base and take his artifact. I'll gather all of my space and land forces and move to Felucia. I don't intend to stay very long -- the planet is too powerful for me to win it over today. But someday, I'll make it a permanent addition to my Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_14,Tyber Zann: In order to steal the artifact from Jabba and the Empire, we need to make a stealthy approach to Felucia.  One of the special talents of my Defilers is their ability to sabotage structures on enemy planets.  Take this Defiler to Felucia and destroy the Orbital Long Range Scanner there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_15,Hint: Drag the Defiler to the glowing oval slot on Felucia and destroy the Ion Cannon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_16,Tyber Zann: Felucia is our goal, but we do not want to draw the Empire's attention.  We will bribe our way past Nal Hutta, and crash Jabba's meeting on Felucia.  Combine all of our forces at Ryloth, and then move them to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_17,Hint: To see the cost of bribing your way to a planet, drag your force to your final destination without releasing the mouse button.  The bribe cost will be listed next to your fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_18,Hint: Include Tyber in the invading space fleet and bring all of our space units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_19,Tyber Zann: Now that I've secured the space above Felucia, I can use land forces to raid the planet. There, I'll find the artifact, which I'll use to fund my criminal empire to its fullest potential.  Bring all of my land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_20,Hint: Bring all of your land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_21,Tyber Zann: Remember to use the abilities of our heroes to gain an upper hand in this battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_22,Tyber Zann: I speak to all of you from the lead transport dropping down to Felucia. Today we strike against Jabba the Hutt. He's an evil creature that has cost the Zann Consortium dearly. Today we get it back. Urai my trusted Vigo is going to collect an important artifact. Make sure all of you help him in his quest. Over and out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_23,Urai: This operation carries great risk, Tyber. Are you sure this artifact is worth it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_24,Tyber Zann: I know how much Jabba paid for it, and that he planned to sell it to the Empire for far more. But he's not half the businessman I am, Urai. I'll get twice as much as that worm could ever secure. Just make sure to do your part. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_25,Tyber Zann: Excellent.  We can now use Felucia to produce advanced ships.  I will leave it to you to capture the remaining planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_26,Hint: Use the saboteur to spread corruption to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_27,Conquer the remaining planets in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_28,Tyber Zann: Our Mercenaries are equipped with disruptor technology from the Black Market.  Use these weapons when fighting enemy infantry.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_29,Hint: Make sure you include Tyber in the invading fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_30,Tyber Zann: Their forces are too powerful; we can't take them on just yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_31,Tyber Zann: A bunker!  I can use these structures to protect my men on the planet, and to hold key areas of the battlefield.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_32,Tyber Zann: This terrain is far too dense for vehicles, but Consortium troops will have no problem moving through it on foot.  Let's use this to our advantage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_33,Tyber Zann: Since we have Destroyers in orbit, we can order an orbital bombardment.   This Rebel base would be an ideal target for this new weapon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_34,Tyber Zann: This would be an ideal time to use the cloaking technology that we purchased on the Black Market.  Use this ability on our Vengeance-Class ships to launch a sneak attack on the nearby Rebel turrets.  They'll never know what hit them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_35,Tyber Zann: The enemy has bomber units, but we did not come unprepared.  We can easily counter these pests by using the defensive systems on our new Crusader Gunships.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_36,Tyber Zann: We are not bound by the same restrictions that plague our enemies.  There will be no Imperial bureaucracy to slow us down; nor do we adhere to some ridiculous moral code, as do the Rebels.  Nothing will stand in the way of our success.  We will corrupt, sabotage, and annihilate our enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_37,Tyber Zann: I need credits to further grow the Zann Consortium!  I must spread corruption to nearby planets with Defilers.  Once it has been established, my corrupting influence will automatically begin siphoning a percentage of each planet's income.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_38,Hint: Click the Base Layout button on the planetary detail screen or scroll your mouse wheel to zoom in 2 times to see the positions of enemy structures and forces.  Scroll your mouse wheel again to zoom out, or click on the magnifying glass icon in the lower left hand corner
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_39,Tyber Zann: Excellent, these Buzz Droids are just the thing I need to destroy Jabba's offworld ships. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_40,Tyber Zann: Whenever an enemy planet has been corrupted we can spy on the activity on that planet. In this case, it appears that the Rebel Alliance is defending Felucia with an Ion Cannon. I hate surprises...
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_41,Tyber Zann: Everyone has a price… use my Bribery ability to sway enemy units to our side. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_42,Tyber Zann: These asteroids pose no threat to my ships. The Rebels and Imperials wish they could say the same! I can use this advantage as part of my tactics, to hide from or evade my enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_43,Tyber Zann: This Rebel space station is heavily shielded, but our Keldabe ship has the ability to drain enemy's shields.  Let's use their own shields against them!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_44,Hint: Click the Base Layout button on the planetary detail screen or scroll your mouse wheel to zoom in 2 times to configure your base layout to your preferences.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_45,Tyber Zann: Since this planet has been corrupted by our influence, we will receive a bounty for every enemy that we kill.  Apparently, crime does pay.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_46,Tyber Zann: The information I received through bribery has allowed me to pinpoint the location of Jabba's forces. He's set up near an Imperial generator. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_47,Tyber Zann: Destroying the power generator will render the Rebel base shield useless and allow us to launch an assault on their base.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_48,Hint: As long as their base shield is active our planetary bombardment is useless against their factories.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_49,Hint: Defilers spread the will of Tyber Zann across the galaxy.  They infiltrate and corrupt planets using bribery, extortion, and assassination, and other underworld tactics. There will be choices to make when corrupting a world. These choices determine many things, including the types of units each world produces for the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_50,Hint: From the Advanced Base Layout screen, you can arrange troops and base structures to better defend planets in your possession. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_51,Hint: Technology purchased from the black market will vary depending on many factors.  The cost of stealing certain technologies will change depending on the current tech level of the enemy you're stealing from. The items you gain from Black Markets across the galaxy will improve with the number of Black Markets you set up.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_52,Hint: The cost to destroy each structure is displayed next to it. For our purposes, the Ion Cannon is the only structure that is affordable to sabotage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_53,Tyber Zann: Direct these mercenaries to enter the bunker by selecting them and clicking on the bunker.  This will garrison them inside the bunker and protect them from any damage, while allowing them to fire upon any nearby enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_54,Hint: To call down reinforcements, click the Call for Reinforcements button.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_55,Hint: Now drag the F9-TZ Transport company from the reinforcement window to your reinforcement point on the land map.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_56,Tyber Zann: Now that those pests have been taken care of, we need to take out that shield generator.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_57,Hint: Load your units into the troop transport by selecting them and clicking on the transport unit, then move the transport to the designated area.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_58,Hint: Some areas are impassable to vehicles and can only be reached by infantry.  Eject your troops and send them to attack Jabba's forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_59,Jabba's Troops: We're under attack call for back up!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_60,Jabba's Troops: There's too many of them! We can't hold out! Where are those reinforcements?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_61,Jabba: Do not fail me! I've arranged for Imperial reinforcements. If you lose my artifact to Tyber Zann, you will suffer a slow and painful death! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_62,Tyber Zann: Now that our way is clear, take our forces and destroy the enemy’s base. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_63,Tyber Zann: I don't know what this artifact is, but if Jabba thought it was worth a planet's ransom, it's worth finding out. I'm sure whatever secrets it holds will be well worth the cost of this little operation. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_64,Tyber Zann: Urai, you are the only one I would trust with this artifact. Take it and guard it with your life. I'll meet with you at the rendezvous point, where we can celebrate our victory. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_65,Stormtrooper: Tyber Zann! You're under arrest for crimes against the Empire. Drop your weapons! If you do not come peacefully, we are authorized to use force!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_66,Tyber Zann: More like crimes against Jabba the Hutt. Oh, I'll go peacefully. But you won't hold me for long. On that, you have the word of Tyber Zann.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_67,Jabba: Tyber Zann. You were scheduled to join me days ago. I thought perhaps something unfortunate happened…
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_68,Jabba: Zann, you fool! Those are my forces above Felucia! If this is some form of betrayal, you won't live to regret it!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_69,Jabba: Zann, remove your forces at once! If you dare attack my base on Felucia, I will send the entire might of the Empire and its fleets against you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_70,Jabba: Tyber Zann, I know the Imperials have captured you. You will not be allowed the luxury of rotting in prison. My reach is very long. Tell me where you've hidden my artifact! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_71,Tyber Zann: I need to establish a black market on Nal Hutta in order to enhance the abilities of my forces around the galaxy.  Before I can establish a black market, I need to show them what I'm capable of.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_72,Zann Consortium Soldier:  Mandalore's Supreme Strategist is traveling to the Hutt space station in orbit above Mandalore.  If we can successfully perform an act of piracy at Mandalore, it will open the door to creating a black market on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_73,Hint: To perform an act of piracy, drag this Defiler to the 'Spread Corruption' slot on the planet Mandalore. Defilers are special Consortium units, and are the only ones that can spread corruption.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_74,Hint: When a Defiler attempts to spread corruption at a planet, you will be presented with all of the available corruption options at that planet. Notice that there are prerequisites that need to be fulfilled to unlock additional corruption options. Corruption options differ for each planet, so pay close attention to maximize your opportunities.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_75,Hint: Select 'Piracy' from the corruption menu.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_76,Tyber Zann: This will be one of the toughest battles I've ever faced. The people of Mandalore have been among the best warriors in the galaxy for many generations. And I'll be facing their most ruthless clan leader in the space above the planet. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_77,Tyber Zann: I've successfully hijacked the Supreme Strategist's ship. While he rots in our custody, news of our victory will spread fear through every system in the galaxy. Perhaps other worlds will now think twice about defying the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_78,Tyber Zann: Send my lieutenant Urai Fen to Nal Hutta to purchase Disruptor Technology from the Black Market there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_79,Urai Fen: At your service.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_80,Urai Fen: Why an Empire planet?  Would it not be better to set up our black market on a Rebel owned world?  Because of their resistance efforts, they sometimes have access to more exotic technology that we could greatly benefit from.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_81,Tyber Zann: My motives are my own, but I will tell you this.  I was rapidly working my way up through the Imperial Academy, but some took exception to my creative solutions for advancement and had me expelled. I vowed to make them pay for this indignity. The Rebellion, and their worlds, may be useful later, but the Empire will start their repayment to me now. Let's get to work.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_82,Zann Consortium Soldier:  Sir, We've decoded a message from an Imperial outpost on Felucia that grants surface clearance for Jabba the Hutt.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_83,Tyber Zann: This is it.  Jabba is going to Felucia to sell the artifact to the Empire.  We can pose as Hutt Cartel forces and sneak onto the planet surface.  Since they're not expecting us, We'll be able to steal the artifact without much trouble.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_84,Fleet Commander: Incoming shuttle, state your purpose for entering Imperial space.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_85,Zann Consortium Soldier: We represent the Hutt Cartel.  We are under orders to deliver an artifact that Jabba is trading with senior Imperial officers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_86,Fleet Commander: All the Hutt Cartel ships have already arrived and are accounted for.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_87,Zann Consortium Soldier: We are arriving separate from the main Hutt fleet to ensure safety for the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_88,Fleet Commander: You are granted clearance to land at the Hutt landing site.  If there is any deviation from that course, we will fire upon your vessel.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_89,Tyber Zann: This worked out better than I thought.  They've given us the exact location of Jabba and the real artifact. Hurry. We've no time to waste.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_90,Tyber Zann: We need to bring all of our forces to Felucia before we can invade.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_91,Tyber Zann: Corrupting planets has many benefits. Not only can we spy on the forces on a planet, but we are able to study the configuration of the land invasion map.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_92,Tyber Zann: We have failed in our first attempt at corrupting Mandalore.  Fortunately, we have received word that the Supreme Strategist will be making another trip to the Hutt base.  Take this Defiler to Mandalore and try again.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_93,Hint: Be advised that only Zann Consortium heroes are capable of purchasing technology from the Black Market. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_94,Tyber Zann: We don't want to give Jabba any warning.  Leave Mandalore under his control for now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_95,Urai Fen: We need to go into hiding quickly!  Attacking Mandalore would expose us.  We cannot afford that at this time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_96,Urai Fen: It would be foolish to expose ourselves to the Imperials at Nal Hutta.  Let's get to Kamino and out of sight.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_97,Hint: Be sure to make use of the special abilities of your units.  Using those abilities could mean the difference between victory and defeat.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_98,Hint: Once a world has been corrupted, you will be unable to change the corruption type of that planet. If the corruption is removed by enemy heroes, or the planet is conquered, you can re-corrupt it with whatever corruption choices are available.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_99,Hint: The yellow fog surrounding the planets indicates that they are under the corruption influence of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_BRB_VICTORY_COR49_05,Defiler: Bribing those captains worked out well. The thought of having those ships taken away frightened the planet officials. They'll do as we say. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_LOAD_COR49_01,Silri: Another conquest for the Zann Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_LOSS_COR49_04,Silri: I thought they might give us trouble. We know of their defenses now and cannot fail a second time. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_TACTICAL_COR49_02,Silri: The guards in the Fey compound are unusually powerful. We'll focus on one point and fight our way through to grab Garnak Fey. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_VICTORY_COR49_03,Silri: We have the Fey family member in our control, and the planet will do anything to meet our demands.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_01,Tyber Zann:  My stay in prison has not done wonders for the Zann Consortium. Jabba must have already heard of my escape. We need to move quickly. Is there anything left Urai?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_02,Urai Fen: We have only a few outdated speeders. Most of our associates deserted us once you were imprisoned. What are your orders?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_03,Tyber Zann: We shall do as we've always done Urai. There are always worlds that are ripe for corruption. Through Imperial and Rebellion planets we'll spread corruption, and rebuild the Zann Consortium into a crime network that once again will be feared throughout the galaxy. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_04,Urai Fen: Then we will need Defilers. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_06,Defiler: Need something done?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_07,Tyber Zann: There's an remote Imperial colony on Honoghr - If we start by subverting the Imperial Officials there it shouldn't attract undue attention. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_09,Tyber Zann: Word will soon spread that the Consortium is back. I'm sure Jabba is aware of our movements. Setting up a racketeering operation on Shola will let him know that we're back in business.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_16,Tyber Zann: Excellent! Now that we've muscled in on Jabba's action, we have some credits to work with. I've identified Mandal Hypernautics' supply shipments as an easy next target. Hire some pirates to ambush them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_17,Urai Fen: Why Mandal Hypernautics?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_18,Tyber Zann: I can only rely on my strategic intuition so long Urai. Raiding the supply ships will provide us better equipment than what the Hutts are using. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_19,Urai Fen: And how will raiding their supply shipments gain you ships?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_20,Tyber Zann: If the Mandal supply ships are suddenly being raided, they'll need to take appropriate steps to ensure security.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_21,Tyber Zann: Now that our corruption has influenced a few worlds, we will realize a true criminal network. Once we link corrupted planets together,  we can bribe officials into allowing our ships, safe passage through enemy worlds
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_28,Tyber Zann: Of course we could set up a another Racketeering operation there, but I believe in order to truly make our make our mark we need intimidation.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_01,Urai Fen: Soon after you escaped, I went to recover the artifact from its hiding place.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_02,Tyber Zann: Jabba must have given up half his criminal empire to buy that ancient puzzle. I'll bet he expected to double his wealth by selling it to the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_03,Urai Fen: Even at twice his price, the Empire would have paid far too little.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_04,Tyber Zann: So you found out what it is?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_05,Urai Fen: I did gain some information.  The artifact dates as far back as the Sith Wars, making it around four thousand years old.  For such an artifact to be so well hidden for so long… it must contain a secret of great importance.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_06,Tyber Zann: Do you know its origin?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_07,Urai Fen: Based on the design, it is likely a Sith artifact.  I believe it may be a data storage device of some kind, but it also seems to serve another unknown purpose.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_08,Tyber Zann: Fascinating Urai. If we could unlock its secrets, we might find something very useful.  I want you to keep investigating, but not at the expense of our rebuilding.  I want Jabba, the Empire -- everyone -- to know that the Zann Consortium is back.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_09,Urai Fen: Yes Tyber?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_10,Tyber Zann: Make them hurt.  We must let the galaxy know that Tyber Zann and his associates are back. Jabba's days are numbered and I want everyone else to know that as well. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_14,Tyber Zann: It's time I had a look at my prize.  I didn't go through torture at Jabba's hands and years of prison just to let it rot in its hiding place.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_01,Tyber Zann: While I was in prison, one of my cell mates mentioned that the Emperor had a vast collection of treasure that he kept all over the galaxy in hidden vaults. I… persuaded him to share more information with me. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_02,Urai Fen: Only an ex-Imperial Officer would truly know that. Did he mention the location of these vaults?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_03,Tyber Zann: I never found out, unfortunately. I may have been a bit overzealous in my questioning. He may not have known the locations of the vaults but I'm convinced this story is more than just a rumor. And now, we have the perfect opportunity to test the story, thanks to the Rebels.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_04,Urai Fen: The Rebellion? 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_05,Tyber Zann: Alliance forces have destroyed the Imperial Death Star - over Yavin 4. Most Imperial battle stations carry data pods that are to be ejected during emergencies.  Perhaps someone thought to follow protocol before the Death Star was destroyed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_06,Urai Fen: And if the Rebels are still in the vicinity?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_07,Tyber Zann: The Rebels will be there, they have an entire base on Yavin IV and have no where else to go. The Empire will soon send a fleet to retaliate. We must move quickly to find the data pod.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_11,Urai Fen: There are a few planets between us and Yavin that the Consortium does not control; what is their fate?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_12,Tyber Zann: Corrupt them, conquer them, be creative Urai. Just remember that getting to Yavin is our goal.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_01,Tyber Zann: Well would you look at that.  I love it when I'm right.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_02,Urai Fen: What have you found?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_03,Tyber Zann: Based on records of the Emperor's transmission's, I believe the vaults are very real. There are technical plans for new ships and most importantly, construction schedules for the Emperor's new flagship over Kuat.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_04,Urai Fen: It must be the largest in the Imperial fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_05,Tyber Zann: Indeed it is.  According to this, the Emperor has visited the ship under construction on many occasions.  If he was there, then it will have a link to his private files.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_06,Urai Fen: The vault locations will be there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_07,Tyber Zann: Yes. And with the wealth in those vaults, I can build a criminal empire that makes the Black Sun look like a swoop gang.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_08,Urai Fen: We will need to infiltrate the ship, then find a way into the Emperor's private files. It will not be easy. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_09,Tyber Zann: Details, Urai. Details. As long as the ship is there, I'm certain we can find our way on board, and find what we're looking for. But I'm not mounting a raid on Kuat until I know the ship is where it's supposed to be. We'll need to verify its presence, somehow. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_10,Urai Fen: The black market on Kuat might have that information.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_11,Tyber Zann: I've been meaning to pick up some new tech for the soldiers on Kuat anyway. Jabba's been too quiet lately. He'll be paying us a visit soon. I'd like to have a few surprises ready for him.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_12,Defiler: I've located the Emperor's new flagship. It's being constructed in the Kuat shipyards, just as you suspected. The security forces around the site appear formidable.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_13,Tyber Zann: No security is infallible. Nobody rests in this organization until we've found a way in.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_03,Tyber Zann: Ahh Disruptors, finally.  Disintegrates durasteel, wood, flesh, just about anything really.  Just the thing for removing large troublesome obstacles, like Jabba for instance.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_11,Tyber Zann: Remind me to check the black market on Rebel-controlled worlds as well. They may have discovered weapons unknown to the Empire. It appears it will be very difficult getting onto that ship.  Wonderful name it has - the Eclipse.  It certainly blocked out my view of the shipyards.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_12,Urai Fen: Can we get in for a closer look?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_13,Tyber Zann: They have an armada of ships guarding that thing. I doubt they're providing tours to the public. Still, there must be a way. I'll think of something. I always do Urai.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_14,Tyber Zann: Well done, now that our defilers have set up the black market, I can buy what I need and perhaps learn more about the Emperor's flagship.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_01,Soldier: Our Barracks have been destroyed. We have reports of simultaneous bombing and sniper attacks from every sector. The defenses at our main bases are holding, but the Consortium has taken heavy damage throughout the galaxy. No word on who's behind the offensive.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_02,Tyber Zann: Jabba has now become a much bigger part of my plans. I'll kill him, but I must make sure he has a chance to suffer. He has struck first, which bothers me, but I'll pay him back, at triple the cost. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_03,Jabba the Hutt: (translated)   Tyber Zann. How nice to see you again. The look of surprise when the stormtroopers took you away is one of my fondest memories...  It was almost as enjoyable as picking over your little operation while you rotted in jail. You must be a fool to steal from me again. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_04,Tyber Zann: Jabba!  How's the desert planet treating you?  Dried up and died yet?  No?  Well that's to bad.  Now get out of my comm system. How did he find us here?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_05,Soldier: We traced the signal to Saleucami.  It looks like Jabba maintains a small comm outpost there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_06,Tyber Zann: I want control of that comm outpost so we can do a little eavesdropping of our own. Saleucami needs to be softened up in preparation for our landing.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_07,Soldier: Right away!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_08,Tyber Zann: The shield generator is our  target - take it out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_09,Tyber Zann:  I want this planet in my pocket - make it happen, Urai!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_10,Tyber Zann: Well done Urai.  Lets find and destroy Jabba's presence on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_14,Defiler: There's been another wave of attacks on our forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_15,Tyber Zann: Kill any of our surviving officers who may have  allowed this to happen and enlist new recruits.  The Zann Consortium will not tolerate weakness in our ranks.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: Saleucami can wait, my attention is needed elsewhere.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_01,Tyber Zann: It seems Jabba has been digging up the past.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_02,Urai Fen: How so?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_03,Tyber Zann: According to data we recovered on Saleucami, Jabba's stumbled across an old battle droid factory on Hypori that somehow survived the Clone Wars.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_04,Urai Fen: The factory is still functional?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_05,Tyber Zann: My sources believe it is. Jabba has been unable to get the factory operational. I want control of it so I can begin manufacturing an invasion army of my own.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_06,Urai Fen: It could be a trap. There's already a Hutt bounty on your head…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_07,Tyber Zann: As much as I doubt Jabba's intelligence, I do pay you to be cautious. I'm sending you ahead of the main force to scout out the situation. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_11,Tyber Zann:  Urai, have you learned any more about our mysterious artifact?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_12,Urai Fen: With more time I will unravel this mystery, Tyber.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_00,Han Solo: I hope you're right about these coordinates Chewie
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_01,Han Solo: You said it buddy. Anyone willing to pay this much money for a spice run is probably looking to avoid Imperial trouble.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_02,Urai Fen: You have no need to worry, Captain Solo. My employer is an independent interest in this galactic conflict.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_03,Bounty Hunter: And you must be Tyber Zann.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_04,Tyber Zann: A Bounty Hunter, how very appropriate. I would tell you to send my regards to Jabba but you won't get the chance.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_05,Bounty Hunter: I'll tell him when I pick up my bounty.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_06,Tyber Zann: You'd be smart to leave with your skin intact before the prison riot I've planned kicks off, which should be any moment now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_07,Bounty Hunter: I'll be gone by then.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_08,Tyber Zann: You're right, sooner than you thought.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_09,Tyber Zann: Perfect timing as usual Urai.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_10,Urai Fen: We must move quickly to the landing site.  I had the power on your blaster upgraded while you were imprisoned. It should prove very effective. Come. The Zann Consortium awaits your return. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_11,Tyber Zann: I've been here far too long already. I assume you've arranged for a hasty departure? This way!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_12,Han Solo: Hold on a second, where’s my cargo?  And what's with all these people?  I'm not running a passenger ship!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_13,Tyber Zann: Urai, explain things to the prisoners. Their usefulness is at an end.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_14,Urai Fen: Consider it done. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_15,Tyber Zann: I'm your cargo, Captain Solo. Don't worry about the prisoners. They found their way in here, they can find their own way out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_16,Han Solo: Whoa, wait a minute. Your man said this was just a spice run. Now of course I never believed that nonsense about a spice run but I didn't count on an Imperial prison riot!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_17,Tyber Zann: I'll double your already considerable fee.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_18,Han Solo:   I know Chewie, I get the feeling we don’t have much choice if we want to leave here with our skins attached. Get aboard now, we’re leaving.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_19,Tyber Zann: Let's go, Urai. We need to reestablish our criminal network as soon as possible. With Jabba posting a bounty on my head, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be out to stop us.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_20,Tyber Zann: Perhaps some of our comrades can make themselves useful in getting past that turret. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_21,Tyber Zann: Stay clear of those, if you don't like explosions.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_22,Tyber Zann: Those look valuable.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_23,Tyber Zann: I'll take them all, thank you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_24,Tyber Zann: I have a ship waiting nearby. Follow me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_25,Tyber Zann: This way, all of you!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_26,Tyber Zann: The only way you'll be free is to follow my lead. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_27,Prisoner: Let's get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_28,Prisoner: Lead the way!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_29,Prisoner: Finally.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_30,Prisoner: Tyber has escaped! Head for the gates!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_31,Tyber Zann: Come with me men, and the Zann Consortium will rule once more.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_32,Tyber Zann: Remind me to repay Jabba for his kindness once I... once we get out of here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_33,Urai Fen: Wait.  There are some droids up ahead that may cause us problems. I will go ahead and take them out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_34,Tyber Zann: Nonsense. Send the prisoners. It's not as if I intend to bring them with us on the ship. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_35,Han Solo: I'm not waiting around for the Imperial fleet to get here - make it snappy!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_36,Han Solo: Yeah, well... Keep the engines warm.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_37,Tyber Zann: So Jabba sends a Bounty Hunter into my cell to finish me off huh? If you manage to kill me the Consortium will make sure you'd never collect a single credit. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_38,Bounty Hunter: There's nothing left of your Consortium
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_39,Tyber Zann: Still enough to take care of one bounty hunter. On time, old friend, as expected.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_40,Han Solo: There are some stormtroopers here wondering why I'm not loading cargo.  You better hurry up or I'm leaving.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_41,Han Solo: I didn't believe that story about the spice run but I never signed up for a prison break!  Lets get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_42,Han Solo: You're not paying me enough for this. I'm in space in two minutes -- with or without you. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_43,Urai Fen: There is much opposition between us and the ship.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_44,Tyber Zann: Not as many as there would have been if I hadn't poisoned their water supply earlier.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_45,Tyber Zann: That should give the guards something else to shoot at.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_46,Han Solo: It's never a good idea to sneak up on a nervous smuggler this close to an Imperial prison. If I'm startled I might shoot first.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_47,Jabba the Hutt: ho, ho, ho, Tyber Zann, my old business partner! How do you like the accommodations I arranged for you? 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_48,Tyber Zann: Visiting hours are over Jabba. If you're looking for your stolen artifact, don't worry I've got it in safekeeping.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_49,Jabba the Hutt: Then it will remain there forever. Your Consortium and its contacts are no more, thanks to me. You will rot in this prison at least until I can send someone to put you out of your misery.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_50,Tyber Zann: Please send an associate to pay me a visit, I need the company. You'll still never find your lost ancient artifact, what a shame. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_51,Jabba the Hutt: You have stolen something very valuable from me so I in turn have taken everything from you. You have made a grave error in taking my precious artifact, I have come to offer you one last chance to tell me where you have hidden it and I will let you live.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_52,Tyber Zann: The artifact now belongs to me, you can forget about getting it back.  You may think you've wiped out the Consortium but my reach is farther than you think. You are the one who should be watching your back Jabba.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_53,Jabba the Hutt: I thought you would respond with impotent threats. One way or another I'll find the artifact. The bounty I've placed on your head will make for an interesting, if not exciting, stay in prison. The good news is your sentence will not be a long one. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_54,Tyber Zann: Urai, come in at once, do you read me? Urai!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_55,Urai Fen:  Urai here, We are in system, as planned. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_56,Tyber Zann: I'm accelerating our plans. Jabba has sent some of his lackeys to finish the job he couldn't. Get that ship landed, now. I’ll set things in motion here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_57,Urai Fen: Captain Solo wanted more time to slip past the Imperial defenses. I believe I can motivate him with additional credits. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_58,Tyber Zann: We need to make sure that neither Jabba nor the Empire has discovered the location of our hidden palace on Ryloth.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_59,Urai Fen: There has been no unusual activity near Ryloth,  The Hutts are unaware of our palace there and the Imperials have extended themselves trying to quell the Rebellion. We will be able to expand our operations quickly upon your return.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_60,Tyber Zann: The partnership with Jabba was a mistake. No more alliances. We're going to do this our way, We'll corrupt planets one by one and crush all those who oppose us.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_61,Han Chewie, get the Falcon ready, we're leaving.  We didn't sign up for this!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_62,Tyber Zann: Captain, I'm very sorry. I understand your concern, but that's the problem with good help like my lieutenant - by the time I can get a word out to stop him, he's already finished. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_63,Han Solo: When we get out of Imperial space, you're on your own. I never heard of you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_64,Tyber Zann: I'll bribe these fools to aid in my escape.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_65,Han Solo:  It’s about time you guys showed up.  Look, your man Urai here, didn’t say anything about springing prisoners.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_66,Tyber Zann:  I’m already free of my bonds, Captain Solo, as you can plainly see.  How this transpired is none of your concern. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_67,Tyber Zann:  I know you have been inconvenienced, and I am prepared to compensate you.  Shall we say… double your original fee?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_68,Urai Fen:  I have let you live this long, Captain Solo.  Perhaps I should reconsider?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_00,Pilot: We’ve scanned the outer area.  No sign of enemy fleet movements.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_01,Tyber Zann: As I expected.  I want a thorough search of that debris field. Take anything of worth. But do it quickly. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_02,Pilot: What now?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_03,Tyber Zann: Let’s make a final pass.  There must be something worthwhile here. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_04,Pilot: Looks like Rebel ships incoming!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_05,Rebel Ship: Identify yourselves! Send your transponder codes now!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_06,Tyber Zann: Engage the Rebels.  We need to buy more time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_07,Tyber Zann: That may very well be an emergency data pod from the Death Star. Retrieve it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_08,Tyber Zann: Another data pod.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_09,Tyber Zann: There's another data pod.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_10,Tyber Zann: That’s enough.  We have what we came for - prepare to jump to Hyperspace!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_11,Wedge Antilles: Unidentified ships – you are trespassing in Alliance space.  Surrender immediately and prepare to be boarded!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_12,Tyber Zann: Surrender isn’t in an option. Let our enemies fight each other. Stay focused on those data pods.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_13,Wedge Antilles: Red 2 to all Alliance units – we need to regroup for another strike - we’re losing too many fighters!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_14,Tyber Zann: Oh look, the little Rebels are deploying defensive satellites. Do not let their toys interfere with our operation.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_15,Pirate Ship: This is not your fight.  Move along or we’ll add you to the scrap!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_16,Tyber Zann: Brush these insects off. Leave them for the Rebels.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_17,Imperial Ship: Pirates inbound! Maintain the defensive perimeter, we need more time for repairs!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_18,Tyber Zann: Amusing - Imperial vessels licking their wounds. I wonder how that fits into the Emperor's grand vision…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_19,Tartan Commander: There’s the code phrase. Switch your transponders and fall in with Zann’s forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_20,Imperial Ship: Mutinous traitors! Lord Vader will hear of this!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_21,Tyber Zann: Welcome aboard, gentlemen.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_22,Pirate Vessel: Too slow, Zann! You want this, you'll have to  pay for it!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_23,Tyber Zann: What insolence! That vessel has our data pod, do not let it escape!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_24,Pilot: Incoming hyperspace signature! Whatever it is, it’s massive. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_25,Tyber Zann: That would be the inevitable Imperial fleet. Ah, here is their transmission now:
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_26,Imperial Commander: All surviving Imperial forces regroup and reinforce the blockade. Eliminate all remaining vessels. No one leaves here alive.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_27,Tyber Zann: We’re no match for that destroyer. Prepare to evacuate the system!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_28,Tyber Zann: The pirate has dropped the data pod! Retrieve it immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_29,Rebel Commander: We’ve got scavengers on our tail – protect the shuttles at all costs!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_30,Tyber Zann: Hmm… Rebel forces evacuating Yavin. Might be worth a change in plans. Detain the shuttles, confiscate anything worthwhile, and destroy the rest.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_31,Tyber Zann: Scans indicate that wreckage has high mineral value. Inspect the debris and retrieve anything of worth.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_32,Tyber Zann: This one is just useless chatter between the Grand Moffs. Look for another.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_33,Tyber Zann: Hold on…this one details a new warship. I've never seen such an ambitious design... apart from the Death Star. It's apparently under construction at the Kuat shipyards. Interesting. Lets keep collecting data pods
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_34,Tyber Zann: Looks like this one contains some information about the Emperor's archive. Fascinating. Keep looking for more pods around.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: I want to oversee this mission personally.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_FAIL,Tyber Zann: Failure is unacceptable. We'll be better prepared next time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_01,Consortium Soldier: No reports of outgoing transports...nowhere to hide...what is this?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_02,Urai Fen: Jabba’s will be planning an ambush.  Expect resistance at the landing site.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_03,Consortium Soldier: We’ve got a...disturbance…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_04,Urai Fen: This was expected. Maintain defenses here - I will reestablish a reinforcement point.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_05,Hutt Soldier: There he is, just like Jabba warned, an infiltrator!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_06,Urai Fen: Whether Jabba warned you or not is of no consequence. Stand down or be eliminated.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_07,Hutt Soldier: Double pay for the one who takes his head!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_08,Urai Fen: The reinforcement point is ours. Bring in all remaining ground forces. Remember, we need that Comm Station intact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_00,Urai Fen: You have brought help. A wise decision.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_01,Tyber Zann: Why, Urai… are you expecting trouble?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_02,Urai Fen: I would be foolish to expect otherwise.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_03,Tyber Zann: That looks like the control station.  Let's get this factory shut down before anything else happens.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_04,Tyber Zann: The droids must be using those nodes to travel underground
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_05,Tyber Zann: They're coming from somewhere!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_06,Urai Fen: I have managed to set the factory to manual, so we should have no more surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_07,Tyber Zann: You were saying?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_08,Jabba the Hutt: (translated) Ho ho…an insignificant thief like you only has so many chances Tyber Zann. Your chances have just run out. It is good to know that I will soon have back my stolen artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_09,Tyber Zann: Not so insignificant that I can't steal your most precious and valuable artifact. Now I control your little droid factory. Admit it Jabba, you've been beaten.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_10,Jabba the Hutt: (translated) The game is not over Tyber. I knew you were coming, and I thought I would let you clean out the droids for me. You have my thanks - now you can die. Kill them all!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_11,Tyber Zann: I'm sure Jabba's not paying enough for the services of a bounty hunter of your expertise.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_12,Bossk: (translated) It's never enough…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_13,Tyber Zann: Indeed. What would you say if I tripled Jabba's payment, and delivered it in advance?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_14,Bossk: (translated) Where's the target?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_15,Tyber Zann: Jabba, your men are dead, and you’re surrounded. I'd say that puts you at a disadvantage. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_16,Jabba the Hutt: (translated) We can make a deal Tyber! There's no need to do anything…permanent.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_17,Tyber Zann: The only deal that lets you live is this - The price on my head--gone. The hits on my territories--stop.  The planets Saleucami and Hypori--now belong to me.  If I see your people anywhere in my territory, I'll personally come to Tatooine and feed you to your own rancor.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_18,Jabba the Hutt: (translated) Agreed.  Just leave Hutt territory alone and I will leave you to your business.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_19,Tyber Zann: Oh of course, Jabba.  As long as you live, I will leave you to your holdings.  Now, get off my planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_20,Urai Fen: It might be better to simply finish him now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_21,Tyber Zann: Now is not the time for a war with the Hutt cartel. Soon we will have the resources to crush Jabba and the Hutts once and for all. For now he is not an imminent threat.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_22,Urai Fen: I have to get to the controls and deactivate these droids!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_23,Tyber Zann: There are the controls! Quickly -- shut this thing down!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_24,Tyber Zann: Destroyer droids!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_25,Tyber Zann: I have a bad feeling about this.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_26,Urai Fen: Droids!  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_27,Urai Fen: Those turrets are active!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_28,Urai Fen: I must reach the backup systems!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_29,Urai Fen: If I can get this factory operational again, the droids can be reprogrammed to fight for us!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_30,Tyber Zann: Go!  I'll hold 'em off!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_31,Urai Fen: Protect the droid nodes!  They should prove useful.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_32,Tyber Zann: We've got to recapture those landing platforms or we'll never get our cargo out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_33,Tyber Zann: We're losing droid nodes fast!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_34,Tyber Zann: Don't just stand there!  Capture that landing platform!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_35,Urai Fen: It would be best to forget that option. They are magnetically sealed. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_36,Tyber Zann: It's no use. Those doors are magnetically sealed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_37,Tyber Zann: We'll have to find another way around.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_38,Urai Fen: We cannot open those doors until the power is shut down. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_39,Tyber Zann: Landing zone captured.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_40,Tyber Zann: We've got one landing zone, there's three more!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_41,Tyber Zann: Halfway there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_42,Tyber Zann: Just need to take one more.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_43,Tyber Zann: We've taken them all.  Now what?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_44,Tyber Zann: I don't know how to use this thing.  Urai get over here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_45,Urai Fen: I will need one minute to complete this. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_46,Tyber Zann: We might not have a minute.  Hurry it up!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_47,Urai Fen: Tyber, I have re-routed the systems in the Droid Works - we now have complete control over the destroyer droids.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_48,Tyber Zann: We can't defeat these droids!  We've got to get to the controls!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_49,Tyber Zann: Is the factory open for business?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_50,Urai Fen: The emergency defenses are active. The droids will pursue us until I can shut them down.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_51,Tyber Zann: Can we get to the shutoff controls?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_52,Urai Fen: They are deep within the factory. We can reach them, if we avoid any unnecessary conflicts.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_53,Tyber Zann: Backing down from a fight?  Urai, don't tell me you've grown soft while I’ve been away.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_54,Urai Fen: I said nothing about backing down - we likely won't have that option.  Droidekas are fast...very fast.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_55,Urai Fen: The battle class droideka is 1.83 meters in height and has a built in shield projector, making it a formidable threat to infantry and light vehicles.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_56,Tyber Zann: I've never encountered one myself, but I've heard the stories.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_57,Urai Fen: It has twin rapid-fire blaster cannons…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_58,Tyber Zann: ...meaning you don’t want to be up against a mob of these things.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_59,Urai Fen: Exactly.  This model is also equipped with ion blasters, allowing them to cripple shielded units.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_60,Tyber Zann: That kind of versatility could prove useful.  Are we at the controls yet?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_61,Urai Fen: We should be near.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_62,HINT: Prices have changed in the black market.  Visit Imperial and Rebel worlds to see what's available.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_63,Tyber Zann: Ending this feud with Jabba allows me to concentrate on bigger fish. Our influence is spreading, Urai. My defeat of Jabba allows me to take on my true enemy, the Empire. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_64,Urai Fen: What about the forces of the Rebellion? Their power is growing. They could prove a useful ally. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_65,Tyber Zann: What do I care for their cause. They've done nothing for me. I'll play both sides. No one is doing us any favors so they'll get none in return. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_01,Urai Fen: Between Jabba, the Empire and your quest for information about the Sith artifact, we may be overextending our capabilities.  Furthermore, I have heard reports of insubordination among our Defilers. The situation seems very dangerous.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_02,Tyber Zann: Urai, where there is power, there are always threats and dissentions. We will deal with them accordingly. I suspect there is great power in that Sith artifact. Something that might give us the advantage we need to rebuild the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_03,Tyber Zann: I've heard the same whispers regarding our Defilers.  I won't have our secret base above Ryloth compromised. Add another layer of brain washing to their training regiment. I want to ensure their loyalty. Urai, you know I have always trusted your wisdom in these matters. Ignore these distractions and move forward as planned.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_04,Urai Fen: Have we found any weaknesses in the blockade at Kuat?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_05,Tyber Zann: The Imperial forces are not going to stop me. But they've certainly slowed my progress. Our answers lie within the Eclipse but I still see no way to reach it, given its defenses.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_06,Urai Fen: In time, a weakness will reveal itself. Perhaps we should shift our focus to the artifact?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_07,Tyber Zann: You said that it was a Sith creation, yes?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_08,Urai Fen: Yes.  A data storage device, perhaps more.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_09,Tyber Zann: What do we need to access it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_10,Urai Fen: Knowledge of the extinct Sith ways, someone who could manipulate the dark side of the Force. Someone with that ability would be very rare, difficult to track down, and approach.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_11,Tyber Zann: Darth Vader may be the only known Sith Lord in existence, and I doubt he'd be cooperative. If another with this knowledge exists - I need you to find them and enlist them to assist us. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_01,Urai Fen: It seems that things are going according to plan, Tyber.  Our pirates at Mandalore report that Mandal Hypernautics is trying to buy a cease-fire with new ships.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_02,Tyber Zann: Excellent!  Tell the pirates to cut a deal - cease hostilities in exchange for new ships, at a reasonable price of course
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_03,Chairman: You leave them out of this Zann. I'm calling to get help. We've lost three shipments to pirates in our system. You will get your ships the moment they are scrubbed clean from my skies. And if you ever touch my family I'll see you dead.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_04,Tyber Zann: We're business partners. But you have to understand the cost of doing business with the Zann Consortium. Why haven't your corporate fleets destroyed these pirates?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_05,Chairman: It would be bad for business - some of the pirates are our best customers.  Besides. if we were to reveal the true size of our navy, the Emperor would start paying more attention to who our clients are.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_06,Tyber Zann: I could easily slaughter these pirates. Of course, everything has it's price. If I clean up your problem, what's in it for me besides the ships I already expect? 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_07,Chairman: I'm sure some kind of compensation could be arranged…perhaps first rights to our newest products?  I might even be able to arrange a discount of some kind.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_08,Tyber Zann: Then we are in agreement. I'll destroy the pirates and expect your delivery shortly. Over and out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_09,Urai Fen: I will see that it is done.  Also, the Pirate captain sent over one of the ships. Curious. Why did he not keep it for himself?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_10,Tyber Zann: That should be obvious Urai - fear.  My reputation is spreading deep into the galaxy, and the captain knows well what would happen if he tried to steal from me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_11,Urai Fen: I see.  Well at least we won't have to actually pay them now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_13,Chairman: You are a man of your word.  Our newest corvette has just finished production - the Crusader-class.  I'd like you to have one as my gift.  Our shipyards and factories are always open for your business.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_14,Tyber Zann: You may want to call home, Chairman.  Poor little Amelia has just had a terrible experience. It seems someone has just shot out the eyes of her new birthday pony while she was riding it. Over and out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_01,Urai Fen: I think I have located a potential source of dark side Force users for you.  There is, however, a complication.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_02,Tyber Zann: Someone stands in our way?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_03,Urai Fen: The planet Dathomir holds many Force users of great power.  However, the Emperor found it before we did and he has blockaded the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_04,Tyber Zann: I see.  No need to confront the Empire head on there. We're better off sneaking into the planet with a small force and taking what we want under their noses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_05,Urai Fen: It may be possible to land undetected, but the sensors on the planet are very good.  We will soon be detected, unless we disable the Empire's sensor web.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_06,Tyber Zann: Send for some Defilers. We'll have them sabotage the sensor system, and then we'll take a shuttle down ourselves.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_12,Tyber Zann: The way is clear.  Let's go, Urai.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_17,Tyber Zann: Urai, this mission is for you and I alone -- just like old times. The Empire is watching this planet too carefully. We need to move swiftly and undercover.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, you have an incoming transmission on your private channel.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_02,Tyber Zann: Impossible!  How did you find me?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_03,Thrawn: Of course I was aware you had taken Jabba's comm node on Saleucami; tapping into it to reach you was trivial.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_04,Tyber Zann: I shouldn't be surprised that you were able to track me down.  I see you've risen quickly in the Imperial Ranks.  With the way the Empire treats non-humans, I'm surprised you're not commanding a garbage scow somewhere.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_05,Thrawn: My capabilities have proven more than enough to inspire the Emperor's tolerance. Ironic that you were once one of the Academy's most promising students. Now, you're an outcast, and foolish enough to try and pay your way by attacking Imperial holdings. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_06,Tyber Zann: I took nothing the Empire wasn’t going to lose to the Rebels anyway. Watch me too closely Thrawn, and you will not like what I have to show you. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_07,Thrawn: A clumsy threat, Tyber, and an empty one. You may be king among your little cadre of bandits, but you will soon provoke a response beyond your capacity to comprehend. Consider this warning a courtesy from an old friend. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_08,Tyber Zann: Your crumbling Empire and its aging admirals may find they have their hands full with the Zann Consortium this time around, Thrawn. You'd think a tactical genius such as yourself would see that coming.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_09,Thrawn: What I see is a petty criminal who will be destroyed the moment he rises from the sludge and attracts the attention of the Empire. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_01,Silri: I have translated the characters on the artifact as you asked.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_02,Tyber Zann: Have you? Please. Enlighten me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_03,Silri: It appears to be an ancient star map, including hyperspace travel vectors.  Unfortunately, the artifact only lists territories already mapped centuries ago.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_04,Tyber Zann: Seems every Sith artifact in existence is some sort of ancient star map, doesn't it Urai? Worthless. Perhaps I can find a gullible buyer with deep pockets. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_05,Silri: I wish to study it further.  I found the artifact holds little in the way of useful information, but it could be useful for translating other Sith texts.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_06,Tyber Zann: We may know it's useless, but I intend to find a buyer that doesn't.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_07,Silri: Its information might yet yield great power…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_08,Tyber Zann: I will contact you should I decide to make further use of it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_09,Silri: …so be it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_10,Urai Fen: She looked as though she was ready to kill you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_11,Tyber Zann: Think nothing of it Urai. Dathomir witches always look as if they're ready to kill. Keep an eye on her.  This artifact is the only leverage I have over her, and I want her kept on a short leash.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, you have an incoming transmission.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_02,Tyber Zann: Xizor!  How good to see you again!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_03,Xizor: You address me as an equal, Zann. I assure you, we are not. I contact you only because of that Sith artifact you possess.  I was going to broker the original deal with Jabba and the Empire, before you stole it. Your interference cost me a great deal.  I assume it is still in your possession?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_04,Tyber Zann: You're in luck, Xizor. I do indeed have the very thing you speak of. You know I've heard the Emperor is a collector of such Sith antiquities, perhaps you could put me in touch with him?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_05,Xizor: I could be persuaded to put you in contact with the Emperor, or at least one of his representatives. But you'll need to do something for me first.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_06,Tyber Zann: Of course, good Prince. What service could a simple man, such as myself, provide?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_07,Xizor: There is a job I need done on Bespin.  Specifically, I wish for you to procure a shipment of Tibanna gas.  Succeed, and you get half the gas, plus your Imperial contact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_08,Tyber Zann: A pleasure, Prince Xizor. And of course, I would not insult you by mentioning what would happen should I be double crossed. This shouldn't take long.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_09,Urai Fen: I do not trust Xizor; it must be a trap.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_10,Tyber Zann: Of course, but Xizor's made the mistake of setting his trap on the planet Bespin.  That world is under the personal control of Darth Vader.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_11,Urai Fen: And how would that help our cause?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_12,Tyber Zann: Xizor is clearly hoping to get us killed so that he can claim the artifact and give it to the Emperor himself. Since Xizor and Vader already have a long-standing feud, we just need to take the gas and plant enough evidence pointing directly at Xizor's little green head.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_13,Urai Fen: Xizor takes the fall, we get the gas, and keep the artifact. An excellent plan.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_14,Tyber Zann: And most importantly, we gain access to the Imperial security network.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_15,Urai Fen: How do we accomplish that?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_16,Tyber Zann: I know just the droid who can interface with the Bespin facility's computers.  Are you familiar with a droid bounty hunter known as IG-88?  He has a rather impressive list of accomplishments. Find him.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_17,Urai Fen: I will contact him, he owes me a favor. Consider it done.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_18,Tyber Zann: Oh, and Urai?  Have the boys see if they can pick up some Imperial ships through the usual channels.  I'm going to need them soon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_20,Tyber Zann:  It will take both Urai and I to get the Tibanna gas.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G14_02,Xizor: It seems I misjudged you, Zann.  Stealing that Tibanna gas from Vader must have been very difficult.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G14_03,Tyber Zann: You neglected to mention Vader's presence.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G14_04,Xizor: Merely a test to see if you were smart enough to do your research - you passed.  Now then, I will be happy to arrange your meeting with the Empire. I'll send you the rendezvous coordinates and details soon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_01,Urai Fen: I see you kept a large portion of the Tibanna gas - you have plans for it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_02,Tyber Zann: I've blackmailed some engineers to start production on the ship designs we scavenged from the wreckage of the Death Star. We'll use the Tibanna gas for the hyperdrives and weapon systems. The first of the new ships should be ready now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_03,Urai Fen: The Vengeance Frigate - an interesting design.  And the other ship?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_04,Tyber Zann: The other design will be my flagship, but it will take more time to complete.  Once it is we'll find a suitable opponent to test its capabilities. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_05,Urai Fen: Do we really want to create yet another enemy?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_06,Tyber Zann: We'll play one force against another. Which is why I asked you to get those Imperial ships.  We're going to flush them out using Imperial ships and Vader's codes.  The Rebels will think the Empire is after them and flee, never to return.  We get the asteroids for our production facility, and the Empire gets to think they destroyed yet another Rebel cell.  Everyone is happy!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_07,Urai Fen: Except the Rebels of course. I would not want to have you for an enemy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_08,Tyber Zann: True...  Oh, and remember to hide those ships in some out of the way spot after the battle - They'll be too hot to use for a bit.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_10,Rebel Pilot: Sir! Incoming Imperial taskforce!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_11,Urai Fen: Excellent - Tyber's plan is working perfectly.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_12,Urai Fen: This mission is under my command - it cannot begin without my presence.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, we've received rendezvous coordinates from Prince Xizor.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_02,Tyber Zann: Have we now?  That is quite interesting.  Well then, we shouldn't keep our Imperial friends waiting.  Invite Bossk to come along would you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_03,Urai Fen: Why Bossk?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_04,Tyber Zann: I have a job for him, though he doesn't know it yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_05,Silri: You should not take the artifact into Empire-controlled space. Are you mad? Whatever your plans, this must be a trap!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_06,Tyber Zann: Your concern is touching. And besides, why would it matter to you? It's just a worthless old map, isn't it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_07,Silri: That artifact is important to my clan, the Nightsisters. I've told you I wish to study it further. It would be a terrible mistake to let it fall into Imperial hands.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_08,Urai Fen: It is not your place to question Tyber, be silent or I will personally introduce you to my blades - a task I will find most satisfying. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_09,Silri: Your blades will meet my whip.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_10,Tyber Zann: Enough. I have a business to run. I don't need distractions right now.  Once we have the Emperor's vaults, feel free to kill each other. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_11,Silri: This is not over…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_00,Tyber Zann: What a cheerful location.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_01,Urai Fen: We must be cautious.  This planet resonates with the power of the dark side.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_02,Tyber Zann: Why Urai! Did you become a Jedi knight while I was in prison?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_03,Urai Fen: My people are not Jedi or Sith.  But our existence has always been tied to the Force. We are aware of its presence.  It is strong here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_04,Tyber Zann: I'm a bit disturbed that you've kept this from me, old friend. Although it doesn't surprise me that you have some Force awareness.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_05,Urai Fen: I understand, it is something I rarely speak of.  The power of the Force on this world could be a threat if it were ever unleashed. The Empire's interest in Dathomir is now apparent.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_06,Tyber Zann: Very well. Let's find someone who can use it to open the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_07,Silri: It is painful to see a trusted friend locked in this cell. You will open the door now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_08,Tyber Zann: Urai, if she tries that mind control trick again, shoot her. Silri, I assume. We're not nearly the weak minded fools you take us for.  Though I am willing to open this door on my terms.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_09,Silri: Do not taunt me. When I'm free of this cell you'll be the second one I kill, no matter the cost! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_10,Tyber Zann: Now now now, you'll get out, as long as you give me a reason to release you. Do you know what this is?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_11,Silri: A Sith creation. If it is real it must be very ancient. Where did you get it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_12,Tyber Zann: Where or whom I got it from doesn't matter.  Can you access the information stored inside?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_13,Silri: I... could, given time.  But I would demand more than just my freedom in payment. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_16,Tyber Zann: Name your price. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_17,Silri: I'll need transport off this planet in order to gather the needed resources. I ask one other thing - Revenge on my captor. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_18,Urai Fen: Do not trust her, Tyber. Even now, she is reaching out to you with the dark side, prying at your defenses…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_19,Tyber Zann: I’m not concerned about our lovely Silri, Urai. For now, at least, our goals are mutually beneficial.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_20,Silri: Understood, now release me from this cell and we’ll go to kill the Imperial Governor that put me on display in this cage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_21,Silri: That is the Imperial Governor’s stronghold.  His lifeless body will send a message to the Emperor. The use of Dark Force powers against his army should convince the Emperor it would be wise to leave Dathomir.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_22,Imperial Governor: Wait, please! I'm worth more to you alive! Your message will get out through my ransom! Your demands will be met!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_23,Silri: My message will be sent -- written in your blood.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_24,Tyber Zann: There, now. That worked out well for you. Now it is time for you to hold up your end of the bargain.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_25,Silri: I will unlock the secrets of the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_26,Urai Fen: This is a mistake Tyber.  She will betray you as soon as she gets what she wants.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_27,Tyber Zann: This is a chance we have to take - She can access the  artifact and uncover its secrets. Once my plans are set in motion, you can have the pleasure of killing her.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_28,Prison Guard: Kill her before she reaches the Rancor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_29,Prison Guard: It's too late!  Run!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_30,Nightsister: Now - Feel my wrath!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_31,Tyber Zann: These women interest me. If we could release them, and enlist them against the Empire… 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_32,Urai Fen: We should avoid of these rancor for now.  They may prove useful when we free some of the prisoners.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_33,Tyber Zann: The sensors in those guard towers won't be fooled by our cloaking fields.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_34,Urai Fen: There is a saying among my people: Do not fight through the shell when you can cut through the underbelly. There may be a back door to the complex that will necessitate much less bloodshed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_35,Tyber Zann: Looks like a path that leads towards the back of the prison complex.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_36,Urai Fen: Once inside the complex, it would be wise to shut down power to the automated defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_37,Tyber Zann: Our cloaking fields should get us past the patrols.  Let's take out the power, then we'll be clear to take out the prison.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_38,Nightsister: Why have you released us?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_39,Tyber Zann: We see that there is no love lost between your people and the Empire. We may have more in common that it appears. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_40,Urai Fen: If you help us, we will fight to free your sisters from every prison on the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_41,Nightsister: The Empire will pay for wrongfully imprisoning us.  Bring us to rancor and we'll bring the Imperial forces to their knees.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_42,Urai Fen: Those guns will tear us apart if we do not disable them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_43,Tyber Zann: Guns that large have to be drawing more power than the prison can produce…that dam we passed earlier might be their power source.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_54,Tyber Zann: Do you recognize this artifact? I could reward you handsomely for unlocking it. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_55,Nightsister: The object is of Sith creation. Only the most learned and powerful in the dark ways of the force could hope to break its ancient code.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_56,Tyber Zann: And? Who would be the most powerful among you? Is there one who could do this?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_57,Nightsister: Silri can be found in the Frenzied River Prison to the north. The Imperial Governor placed her in a cage and broadcast news of her imprisonment planet-wide, in order to break our spirit. It didn't work. We rebelled, but many of our number were captured, and imprisoned all over the planet. The Empire is now our mortal enemy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_SAB_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: We need to destroy the orbital sensor array before we can approach Dathomir; trying to land would be suicide otherwise.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_00,Stormtrooper: Your arrival isn't on my schedule. Let me see your identification papers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_01,Tyber Zann: You don’t need to see my identification.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_02,Stormtrooper: This one thinks he’s a Jedi.  And why don't I need to see your identification?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_03,Tyber Zann: Because you're dead.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_04,Tyber Zann: We don't have much time. I'll plant the evidence against Xizor. Urai, see to the Tibanna Gas. IG-88, slice into the Imperial computer banks and get me security access for all of the planets on my hit list. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_05,Urai Fen: Each Tibanna gas collection facility is surrounded by four refineries.  I will need to escort the gas droids to the refineries, where they will procure the gas. We will need to return with eight full droids for this mission to be a success.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_06,IG-88: I'll find the needed planetary security codes by hacking into Bespin's central server cluster. It should only take a few nanoseconds. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_07,Tyber Zann: In order to make this look like a Black Sun operation, I'll need to sneak into the four security outposts and plant information that leaves no doubt that Xizor alone was behind the theft of the Tibanna gas.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_08,Tyber Zann: One outpost down.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_09,Tyber Zann: That's two.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_10,Tyber Zann: One outpost left.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_11,Tyber Zann: That should leave no doubt in Darth Vader's mind that Xizor was responsible for this break in.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_12,IG-88: Cluster located.  Proximity required for access.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_13,IG-88: Accessing data….
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_14,IG-88: Security re-route complete.  Tyber Zann now has access to restricted planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_15,Gas Cargo Droid: Acquiring gas…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_16,Gas Cargo Droid: Gas canister full.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_17,Gas Cargo Droid: Transferring gas…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_18,Gas Cargo Droid: Transfer successful.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_20,Tyber Zann: Urai protect the droids! If you keep losing droids, this mission will be a complete failure.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_21,Tyber Zann: You've managed to lose all the droids. There's no way to collect the gas now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_22,Urai Fen: Tyber, we've collected enough gas.  All droids are returning to the shuttle.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_24,Underworld Soldier: What appears to be Lord Vader's shuttle is on approach for landing at your location.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_25,Tyber Zann: We're going to have to move quickly on our final task if we want to get out of here intact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_26,Field Commander: Sir, a group of smugglers have infiltrated our Tibanna gas refinery.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_27,Darth Vader: You have, of course, captured and detained them?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_28,Field Commander: My Lord, we nearly had them, but they seem to have…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_29,Darth Vader: Not the performance I expect from an Imperial Field Commander. I will seek them out myself.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_30,Tyber Zann: Good work.  Let's get back to the shuttle and get out of here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_31,Darth Vader: Your Report.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_32,Stormtrooper: They escaped with a large supply of Tibanna gas  -- enough to supply a sizable fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_33,Darth Vader: Have they been identified?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_34,Stormtrooper: We've found evidence that suggests the Black Sun criminal organization was responsible.  We also have records that indicate some of the local militia took bribes to allow them to land.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_35,Darth Vader: Execute the local militia and any associates.  Xizor will pay for this transgression.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_36,Tyber Zann: Lets go! Get those droids unloaded!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_37,Tyber Zann: Here's one of the security outposts.  One moment.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_00,Thrawn: Tyber Zann. I've come to collect your artifact for the Emperor. Comply with my demands, and I promise a swift and reasonably honorable death. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_01,Tyber Zann: Thrawn. Of course I knew you were still lurking in my shadows. Don't tell me you're the contact Xizor arranged.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_02,Thrawn: In a manner of speaking, yes.  Xizor is dead. The evidence you planted convinced Vader, but I recognized your unique signature. You've overstepped your bounds for the last time, Zann.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_03,Tyber Zann: Really. You don't think I came unprepared, do you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_04,Thrawn: Well done, for a petty criminal.  Of course I wouldn't have expected you to anticipate the hypervelocity gun on the surface.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_05,Tyber Zann: Well I would expect an Imperial Officer to be arrogant enough not to be ready for my surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_06,Thrawn: Well. This may actually prove interesting. Why don’t we begin?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_07,Tyber Zann: Agreed…for an admittedly brilliant strategist, one thing you've never been, Thrawn, is boring...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_08,Pilot: Bossk has stolen the artifact! He's heading towards Thrawn's ship.  All fire on the Hound's Tooth!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_09,Tyber Zann: No!  Let him go! Let him go.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_10,Thrawn: I'm sure you are now aware, I have what I came for. Goodbye, Tyber. For the last time. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_11,Tyber Zann: The great Admiral Thrawn is running away from a fight?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_12,Thrawn: Unlike you Tyber, I never considered retreating an act of cowardice - it's an option like any other.  In this case, my skills are needed elsewhere, and I've kept you busy long enough.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_13,Tyber Zann: Are you sure you're not just saving your skin?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_14,Thrawn: If I were you I'd be more concerned about my own security, as you will soon discover. Farewell.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_15,Pilot: We're picking up alarm codes from our bases on multiple planets!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_16,Tyber Zann:  I want that Imperial fleet destroyed! We have to find a way through!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_BOUNCE_CORUSCANT,Tyber Zann: A wanted fugitive from Kessel landing on Imperial Center?  I'm bold, but not stupid.  Perhaps another time…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_BOUNCE_ENDOR,Tyber Zann: The Empire has a massive fleet in orbit. They must be protecting something.  Stay clear until the time is right.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_BOUNCE_SULLUST,Tyber Zann: The Rebellion is keeping a large fleet in orbit - they must be planning something.  I won't play my hand just yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_01,Silri: While you sit on your throne looking smug, Bossk has taken the artifact and sold it to the Empire!  And you think a Dark Lord like Vader or the Emperor won't know how to use its power!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_02,Tyber Zann: Are you naïve enough to think I just let things happen that aren't according to my carefully laid plans? You've told me the artifact is useless, I shouldn't be concerned, should I? 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_03,Silri: I…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_04,Tyber Zann: It's almost as if there was something about the artifact that you held back from me. If I have now lost something to them of real value, through some lack of disclosure on your part, why... I might take such a thing quite badly. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_05,Silri: Well…there might have been more…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_06,Tyber Zann: Shocking. Tell me. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_07,Silri: I…I can't be sure.  I believe that there may have been another key that was required. A data lock such as that would be used only to hide something of great importance.  I thought it might be a lost Force technique, known only to the ancient Sith. But it would only be useful only to me and my kind!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_08,Tyber Zann: But... you can't be sure. Correct?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_09,Silri: I did not have time to find the answers. I did not think you would give it away so carelessly!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_10,Tyber Zann: Silri, I want you to listen to me very carefully.  If you ever lie to me again, or hide information from me you and every Dathomiri witch will die the day after you betray me. And I'll kill everyone of those damned Rancors as well. Those orders already stand, and will be carried out, whether I'm alive or not. Do you understand me?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_11,Silri: I've heard enough…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_12,Tyber Zann: These are actions that you will set in motion. Lie to me, betray me, withhold information from me again, and  all of these things will come to pass. Am I as clear as I can possibly be?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_13,Silri: I understand.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_14,Tyber Zann: Splendid!  Now then…Urai, you can begin tracking the locator beacon we placed on the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_15,Silri: What!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_16,Tyber Zann: Did you really think I didn't know what would happen?  I let Bossk steal it.  I am quite willing to sacrifice a million credits when it will lead me to the Emperor's personal archives aboard the Eclipse.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_17,Silri: Why bother getting into the Eclipse at all? You're so vastly powerful now, as you humbly stated a moment ago.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_18,Tyber Zann: I need to access to the Emperor's private command console aboard the Eclipse to get what I really want.  The problem has always been finding the location of the archives that contain the passkey, but Bossk and Thrawn have helpfully solved that problem for me. Do you have it Urai?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_19,Urai Fen: I'm tracking it Tyber, it will take some time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_20,Tyber Zann: I can wait a bit longer.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, we're getting a message from Mandalore.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_02,Tyber Zann: From our pirates?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_03,Urai Fen: Yes.  Their commander seems... excited.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_04,What goes here?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_05,Tyber Zann: Captain?  I trust you have good news?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_06,Pirate Captain: I know the order was to leave Mandal Hypernautics alone, but some of my men couldn't resist of hitting some of their lesser shipyards outside the system.  I seized the opportunity to extort some more new ships from Mandal.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_07,Tyber Zann: Really...and how did they respond?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_08,Pirate Captain: They were only too happy to pay a little more.  We have some new toys for you!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_09,Tyber Zann: Well now, that is a prize - an admirable job Captain.  Except for one thing…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_10,Pirate Captain: What's that?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_11,Tyber Zann: I cannot allow underlings to ignore my orders or the Consortium simply degenerates into a pack of bandits. Lets hope the man who replaces you will remember that.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_01,Iblis: You are a fool Zann!  Don't you see what's happening around you?  The Empire is building another Death Star!  No planet will be safe with that madman in power!  We can win though.  The Emperor and Vader are on board the new Death Star - with your help, we can destroy the battle station and the Empire in one blow!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_02,Tyber Zann: Rebellion, Empire, I don't care. I'm successful in what I do because I stay focused. If one Death Star was destroyed, the new one can be destroyed as well, but I'm not going to bother until it flies to me and tries to kill me and mine. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_03,Iblis: You don…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_04,Tyber Zann: I don't care.  It doesn't matter to me who is in charge.  Empires and Republics will come and go, but there will always be crime and powerful men like me. There will always be credits to steal, bribes to pay, and illegal needs to fulfill for a price.  And I will be the one who controls it all.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_05,Iblis: I was wrong.  Palpatine is mad and evil, but you are worse.  You're like a leech sucking on the lifeblood of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_06,Tyber Zann: Nonsense.  I am a simple business man.  I sell people what they want.  And everyone wants something.  Look at you - you want my help for your Rebellion.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_07,Iblis: I've changed my mind.  The New Republic could never be free owing you any kind of debt.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_08,Tyber Zann: But you are indebted to me - you owe me your life.  Now go.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_09,Urai Fen: Is it wise letting him go?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_10,Tyber Zann: No sense getting the Rebellion more angry than it already is.  If I killed him, he'd never hear about his wife Arrianya. Besides, he gave us something whether he knows it or not…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_01,Tyber Zann: Thanks to spies I have planted in the Rebellion, we know that both the Emperor and Vader are in the Endor system.  That means Coruscant is wide open.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_02,Urai Fen: To Coruscant?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_03,Tyber Zann: That's where we've traced the artifact isn't it? By all indications it's in the Emperor's Imperial Archive.  The Empire is sure to be caught off guard by such a bold raid on the Imperial Archive itself. That passkey is as good as ours.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_04,Urai Fen: Coruscant is going to be heavily guarded, even with the Emperor and Vader absent.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_05,Tyber Zann: Thanks to IG-88's help on Bespin, we should be able to land without interference.  Get Silri and prepare to raid the Imperial archive on Coruscant.  We must get in and out before the Emperor returns from Endor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_06,Urai Fen: Are you sure you want Silri along for this? I--
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_07,Tyber Zann: She is powerful and useful despite her…volatility.  Be ready, though - if she tries anything, I'll require your services.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_08,Urai Fen: I am ready. I look forward to it if the opportunity arises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_01,Silri: I sense a great disturbance in the Force - the balance has shifted away from the dark side.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_02,Tyber Zann: That all sounds very nice, but what does it mean?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_03,Silri: The Emperor, and Vader - they're dead. The Rebels must have destroyed them…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_04,Urai Fen: The Rebels claim it to be true, they are broadcasting it all over the holonet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_05,Tyber Zann: With the Emperor dead, the Empire will be in chaos.  Most of the ships from the Kuat blockade will have returned from the battle over Endor to regroup.  The time to strike is now! We must take control of the Eclipse.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_00,Silri: Tyber Zann is a fool if he thinks I will leave the artifact in the Emperor's hands.  It will be mine!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_01,Silri: Dark Troopers…not so threatening when deactivated.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_02,Silri: I can feel the power of the artifact, it must be nearby!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_03,Silri: Which way?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_04,Silri: There it is.  Once I have all of its secrets, I will kill both of those fools who think to order me around.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_05,Silri: Something is wrong… darkness...   great strength in the Force. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_06,Force Adept: I felt your presence the moment you landed, witch. You should have stayed on Dathomir.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_07,Silri: I am safe on any world I choose, you pathetic weakling.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_08,Force Adept: I'll have your head, and that of your beast, as trophies!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_09,Force Adept: Release that artifact, witch.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_10,Silri: Its secrets are mine, along with your life!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_11,Silri: It looks like we're trapped, we'll need to find a way out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_12,Officer: I'd be killed if anyone knew I let you in here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_13,Tyber Zann: You're probably right.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_14,Force Adept: Well, well… The great Tyber Zann.  I didn't expect to see you here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_15,Tyber Zann: I doubt you expected to die, either. But I'm full of surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_16,Tyber Zann: That should take care of the cameras
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_17,Urai Fen: I can sense the dark side of the Force within you.  It has been a long time since I have had a challenging opponent, do not disappoint me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_18,Urai Fen: There are three more of them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_19,Urai Fen: The power is down.  Now I must reach Tyber.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_20,Tyber Zann: Now that the museum’s defenses are down, we can bring in a little extra security, just as a precaution.  Good thing I left those MDUs parked out front.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_21,Tyber Zann: Damn! A trap!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_22,Urai Fen: This door is being held shut by remote control.  There is nothing I can do to open it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_23,Urai Fen: Got it!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_24,Tyber Zann: Just in time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_25,Urai Fen: I just need a few minutes to find the passkey….
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_26,Tyber Zann: Hmm…  A security system I didn’t plan for.  You can bet the guards are on their way here as we speak.  We’ll have to destroy them to release their control on the door.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_27,Urai Fen: Got it.  Do you want anything else in the vault?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_28,Tyber Zann: Tempting, but there's no time. We have the plans and that’s what we came for. Let's leave while we still can.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_29,Silri: What is it, my pet?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_30,Tyber Zann: What's that thing doing out of its cage?  And why aren't you waiting in the hangar?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_31,Silri: I…sensed something, I went to investigate.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_32,Urai Fen: I will deal with you later. This way. Make haste!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_33,Force Adept: Halt, thieves!  Return what you've taken, and I promise a quick and painless death.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_34,Tyber Zann: You must have no idea who I am…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_35,Force Adept: I know precisely who you are, and the reason you're here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_36,Silri: He's a teleporter!  This could prove interesting.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_37,Tyber Zann: What an amazing gift for understatement you have.  Do we have any MDUs left?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_38,Tyber Zann: Was that really necessary?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_39,Urai Fen: Do you not know what this is?  It is a Juggernaut!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_40,Silri: Let's get out of here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_41,Tyber Zann: I’m not going to lie to anyone.  Breaking into the Emperor’s personal archive isn’t going to be easy, but we need that passkey.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_42,Tyber Zann: So let’s review the plan.  I’ll infiltrate the security section and disable the monitoring controls. That will blind the cameras while we’re breaking into the vault.  After that…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_43,Urai Fen: After that, it is up to me to sneak into the main power grid and shut it down. This will disable the turret guns. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_44,Tyber Zann: …Silri?  Are you paying attention?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_45,Silri: And I wait, while you two get all the glory?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_46,Tyber Zann: You’re guarding our only means of escape. Don’t forget it. Once we have the plans, we’ll need a transport to get past the exit defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_47,Silri: I guess I didn't realize this mission was guard duty.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_48,Urai Fen: Give me the word at any time, Tyber.  I would be more than happy to eliminate her. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_49,Tyber Zann: I hate to admit it, Urai, but I think she's actually growing on me. Of course it's comforting knowing that option is always available.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_50,Silri: There's something troubling here…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_51,Tyber Zann: The vault is open.  Let’s see what’s inside.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_52,Tyber Zann: Why aren’t those Ysalamiri cages being deployed?  We’re in trouble here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_53,Tyber Zann: Everyone into the transport!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_54,Tyber Zann: This thing must move faster.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_55,Silri: Use the laser defenses!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: Urai, Silri and myself are needed on Coruscant. There's really no way we can break in without all three of us. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_00,Tyber Zann: That is the most magnificent thing I've ever seen, Urai, once we take control we'll…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, we are tracking several in-bound fleets!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_02,Tyber Zann: It's probably the remains of the Imperial fleet attempting to repair and regroup here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_03,Urai Fen: There are multiple Alliance signatures as well. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_04,Tyber Zann:  Already? More organized than I thought. Quickly, then! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_05,Han Solo: Unidentified ships, what is your purpose in this sector?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_06,Tyber Zann: We heard of the Alliance's glorious victory at Endor, and have come join.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_07,Han Solo: Listen, Zann. If you're on the level, help us destroy that super star destroyer. You'll be well rewarded.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_08,Tyber Zann: Looks like there are a few space stations between ourselves and the Eclipse.  Take them out!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_09,Han Solo: Alright. Zann, don't think I'm not paying attention. If I smell a double-cross, I won't waste any time taking you out. Oh, and uh, good luck. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_10,Pilot: We've finished scanning the Eclipse Star Destroyer - the main weapon looks to be functional.  If we could board that thing and get our hands on that superlaser…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_11,Tyber Zann: I'm way ahead of you.  Just worry about those defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_12,Pilot: Imperial ships dropping out of hyperspace.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_13,Pilot: More Rebel ships incoming.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_14,Pilot: We've got a massive Imperial fleet heading right for us!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_15,Pilot: Direct Hit! Yeah!!!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_16,Pilot: Whoa!  Look at that!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_17,Tyber Zann: Just like shooting Takaam Pods in a Dalass Pit.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_18,Tyber Zann: You didn't need that, did you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_19,Pilot: What the…  Super Star Destroyer incoming sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_20,Tyber Zann: I bet that cost a fortune.  Oh well.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_21,Tyber Zann: If the Emperor weren't dead, that would have made him quite upset.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_22,Tyber Zann: You fools never learn, do you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_23,Pilot: We've taken control of the Eclipse superlaser!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_24,Tyber Zann: Excellent!  Let's go hunting.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_25,Pilot: We're approaching the space station now, initiating boarding protocols.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_26,Pilot: We've sabotaged the space station's main reactor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_27,Pilot: We've got it! The space station is ours!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_28,Pilot: We're approaching the Eclipse now, initiating boarding protocols.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_29,Pilot: We've taken control of the Eclipse.  There isn't much functional equipment, but the superlaser is operational.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_30,Han Solo: Ok, Zann -- fun's over. You wanted to capture the Emperor's new toy? Fine. Let's see how long you can keep her.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_31,Tyber Zann: Ha! The Rebels have served their purpose…destroy them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_32,Pilot: Sir!  The Eclipse is under attack!  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_33,Tyber Zann: We've lost the Eclipse, all units withdraw.  Repeat, all units withdraw!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_34,Pilot: Sir!  The Eclipse's superlaser has malfunctioned!  We will need some time to make repairs!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_35,Pilot: Sir!  The Eclipse's superlaser is back online and ready to fire!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: The moment of my ultimate triumph cannot be executed with me. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_BOUNCE_GEN,Tyber Zann: Kuat is too hot right now.  I need to formulate a plan before I can tackle this planet and infiltrate the Eclipse.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_01,Urai Fen: Governor Koong Eeth has proven difficult. We aren't going to kill him, when simply maiming him should accomplish our goals. Getting past his impressive security force and severely injuring him sends the appropriate message. No one denies the Zann Consortium ...no one.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_02,Urai Fen: Well done! Fear is one of our most powerful weapons. Word has spread on what we did to the Governor.  In a matter of weeks everyone on Saleucami will do what we tell them. Empire and Rebellion forces will no longer have use of special abilities on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_03,Defiler:  Our reputation of intimidation, has allowed us to successfully set up our racketeering efforts on Felucia.  While the planet seems primitive with its fungi forests, there is much wealth to be gathered. The inhabitants are starved for entertainment of any kind and our organization can provide many services to relieve them of their funds.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_04,IG-88: I am tasked to enter the Kessel system and locate an Imperial Communication Satellite. With that unit in our control, enemy fleet movement will be revealed. We will be able to direct Imperial Fleet traffic in order to steal ships and create havoc in enemy supply lines.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_05,IG-88: We have succeeded beyond my calculations. We have added a new ship to our fleet. We are redirecting enemy credits into our own coffers. Already we have heard reports of transport ships mysteriously disappearing as a result of our taking over control of the communication satellite. The strategy appears to be working and should proceed as planned.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_06,Defiler: I've successfully established a recruitment center on Kashyyyk.  We are limiting Wookie food supplies and they've responded well to the conditioning with only around 300 unable to complete the regiment. The planet is successfully corrupted and these units are at your disposal. Long live the Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_07,Defiler: The vast Kuat ship yards are in your control. I've set up a black market ring to bring the technologies of your enemies into your hands. The Zann Consortium will now be able to use our stolen plans to build units in the future. There was some resistance from a few of the powerful families controlling Kuat, but there's no longer a power base to stop us there at the present time. Long live the Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_08,Urai Fen: Our forces mass to move on the planet. We will not fail the Zann Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_09,Tyber Zann: Well done, this world has been successfully corrupted. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_10,IG-88: I’ve computed a 98% chance of success, begin the battle!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_00,Tyber Zann: Do you see Urai?  Billions of credits! Technical data hoarded for decades!  Priceless works of art!  It's incredible!  There is more wealth in these hidden vaults than even I can imagine!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_01,Urai Fen: An impressive victory.  With the contents of the vault and this ship, there may soon be a new galactic emperor.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_02,Tyber Zann: I've no need to keep the half-constructed Eclipse. And it presents a target even the Rebels couldn't miss. With the treasures from Palpatine's vaults, I can now spread my organization across the galaxy. Let the Rebels form their New Republic! I’ve always wanted to own a Senator…
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_03,Silri: Soon you will understand the true meaning of power Tyber Zann.  When I teach it to you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_04,Silri: Hahahahahahaha!
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_EVENT_FAVOR_02,You show great promise, commander.
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_EVENT_FAVOR_03,Your commanding officer may be right about you.
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_HC_01,I’ve been waiting for you Obi Wan!
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_HC_02,When I left you, I was but the learner, now “I” am the master!
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_HC_03,Your powers are weak, old man!
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_HC_04,You should not have come back!
TEXT_SPEECH_VAD_HC_05,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion!
TEXT_SPEECH_WAYLAND_BLK_VICTORY_COR50_02,Defiler: There are Empire and Rebel technology secrets to be had here and we're starting to collect them now. 
TEXT_SPEECH_WAYLAND_RKT_VICTORY_COR50_01,Defiler: We are successfully luring enemy forces here and taking advantage of their salvage after our forces destroy them in space. 
TEXT_SPEECH_YAVIN_BRB_VICTORY_COR51_02,Defiler: Although Tyber Zann feels the Rebels are insignificant, bribing some of their leaders may prove useful. 
TEXT_SPEECH_YAVIN_RKT_VICTORY_COR51_01,Defiler: Our organization is set up on Yavin 4. Our corruption efforts bring us credits and hopefully more knowledge of the sector.

TEXT_STORY_MISSION_SUPPORT_A_CHANCELLOR_BODY_MONMOTHMA,SUPPORT MON MOTHMA: This option eventually results in the removal of Palpatine from office and prevents the road to Empire, which prevents Order 66 but also denies access to the advanced Imperial ships.
TEXT_STORY_MISSION_SUPPORT_A_CHANCELLOR_BODY_PALPATINE,SUPPORT PALPATINE: This option brings the Republic down the path of Empire. In theshort term it opens up access to limited amounts of advanced KDY ships (ie Imperator, Tector, Secutor) through limited deliveries from the company (not as buildable ships) after a contract is granted, which can be done 5 weeks after choosing Palpatine. Eventually, it leads to the execution of Order 66, which will happen 30 weeks after the KDY contract automatically, but can be triggered early if desired. If Palpatine dies after this option is chosen, you lose the campaign.

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_00,Rescue the Millennium Falcon
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_01,No sooner does the Alliance need the assistance of a smuggler than one they've had past dealings with volunteers - albeit unintentionally.  Han Solo seems to have run afoul of the Empire yet again.  This time, he's caught in a tractor beam of an Imperial Star Destroyer, more than likely looking for illegitimate cargo that he's carrying.  In return for saving his neck, the Alliance will certainly be able to persuade him to assist in future operations.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_02,Task: Take a fleet to Corellia and rescue Han Solo.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_06,Disable the tractor beam holding the Millennium Falcon

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_01,Mon Mothma has sent out the call for Han Solo and Chewbacca, asking them to perform a service in return for a surprisingly large fee.  What the task is, only Mon Mothma can say.

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_23,Get Han and Chewie to the storage area and recover the schematics

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_00,The Defense of Mon Calamari
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_01,Mon Calamari are a fierce and passionate people.  Their spirit rekindled by the return of their enslaved people and the reclamation of their technology, they have revolted against the Imperials that subjugated them.  Staging revolts all over the planet, the Imperials stationed on Mon Calamari were easily overcome.  Rapidly taking the battle into space, they made use of any ships they could to attack the Empire vessels stationed above them.  Finally liberated, they have quickly set about rebuilding their fleet and preparing for all-out war against the Empire.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_02,Wasting no time, the Empire sets a plan in motion to retake Mon Calamari and prevent its people from becoming a threat to Imperial domination.  A massive fleet has been organized, and will soon leave from Imperial controlled space.  Their mission: retake the rebellious planet Mon Calamari.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_03,Task: Defeat the Imperial fleet before it can reach Mon Calamari.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_07,REWARD SYSTEM CUT
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_19,Task: Remove the Empire fleet from Mon Calamari.  Cruisers will not be available for construction until control is restored.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_22,Hint: Mon Calamari can only be approached by three routes - guard them accordingly

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_100,Hint: Target the Tantive IV’s engines to disable the ship.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_00,The Final Battle
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_01,The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star, has been unleashed upon an unsuspecting galaxy.  The planet Alderaan was the first to pay the price, with millions of deaths being the cost.  The Rebel fleet is far too weak to confront the battle station head on, but with the aid of General Dodonna's military knowledge and courageous fighter pilots, the Rebellion may yet have a chance.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_02,Task: Confront the Death Star in a tactical battle that includes Red Squadron.  If Red Squadron survives the battle, Luke can destroy the Death Star and win the game
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_21,Notice: The Droids have returned to Rebel control.  Red Squadron is now available for use.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_23,Task: Do not allow Mon Mothma to be destroyed by the Death Star - her presence is vital to the Alliance, and the game will be lost if she is destroyed.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_24,Hint: The Death Star can only be destroyed by Red Squadron.  Facing it without them will allow you to destroy the accompanying fleet, but the Death Star itself is immune to all other attackers.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_INVALID_ACTION,Mon Mothma: This action seems inappropriate for the situation.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_TECH_ADVANCE,Notice: New technology is now available by using the droids' steal ability
TEXT_STORY_STANDARD_ACT02_NOTICE,Notice: Planets which are not revealed yet will be later.  It is recommended you conquer enemy planets and secure the galaxy before advancing to the next mission.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_AMBUSH_01,We received word from some reliable sources.  Intelligence is reporting that the pirates plan to ambush one of our systems.  Unfortunately, we were unable to determine which planet they are targeting.  Spread your forces to defend each planet as we don't want to be caught without defenses.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_AMBUSH_02,You managed to salvage a victory.  You manage your forces disgracefully.  Hopefully the addition of these forces will compensate for your ineptitude.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_AMBUSH_03,You have failed to heed my warning and your resulting defeat brings disgrace to both of us in the eyes of the Emperor.  Do not fail me again.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_AMBUSH_TITLE,Pirate Ambush
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONQUER_00,We strive to remove all traces of treachery and rebellion from our galaxy.  I have just the target for a cleansing.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONQUER_01,Perhaps I underestimated you.  In any case, I am reassigning troops to replace those you lost.  Try not to lose these.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_00,Apparently the Rebellion takes us for fools.  They seem to believe that we are unaware of their forces assembling on our borders.  I want you meet their attack with a little surprise of our own.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_01,Rebel ships have entered hyperspace.  I expect you to be there in force to greet them when they exit.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_02,You expect congratulations?  The attempted Rebellion assault was beneath pathetic and your response, while satisfactory, was hardly impressive.   
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_03,You have failed to heed my warning and your resulting defeat brings disgrace to both of us in the eyes of the Emperor.  I will not tolerate more losses.  The Rebellion fleet must be wiped out.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDIT_WINDFALL_00,I have discovered some unspent credits in the Imperial coffers.  See to it that these credits are spent wisely.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDITS_00,Your handling of Imperial funds is admirable.  Unfortunately, we need to hold a larger surplus in reserve if we are to succeed over the long term.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDITS_01,Your actions have been satisfactory.  Our scientists have put together a few new weapons that I need tested.  I will require a full report of course.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_01,We strive to remove all traces of treachery and rebellion from our galaxy.  One of our lieutenants has been caught selling supplies to the Black Sun Pirates.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_02,Your tactics are commendable.  In compensation for completing this task you will be given the use of an AT-AT for your upcoming battles.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_TITLE,Pirate Defection
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FAVOR_01,Despite your incompetence, Lord Vader has requested your assistance in a personal errand.  He wants you accompany him to a Rebellion planet to recover some captured Imperial forces.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FAVOR_TITLE,A Favor for Lord Vader
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_00,You have interfered with the Empire for the last time.  Too many have failed in bringing about your termination.  I will be seeing to your destruction personally.  Surrender is no longer an option.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_01,Do not presume that I have been defeated, commander.  When the time is right, I will strike again.  The next time we meet, things will not end as fortunately for you as they have today.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_02,My fleet has failed me.  They were weak and deserved the punishment they received.  Rest easy today, commander, for tomorrow I will return to exact my vengeance.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_03,Yet again you have failed the Empire.  You have allowed a Rebellion fleet to defeat you on your own territory.  If you do not regroup and exterminate these criminals, you will learn how Lord Vader deals with incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_00,I have word from Lord Vader of a Rebel gathering.  Apparently, he has sensed that many of the Rebellion’s leaders are gathered together on one planet.  This is our chance to crush the Rebellion.  Take a fleet and assassinate these dissenters.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_01,You have let another opportunity passed you by.  The Rebellion has learned of our attack and dispersed its leaders.  Lord Vader will not be pleased with your incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_02,We have succeeded in disrupting the leadership of the Rebellion.  Lord Vader is very pleased with our actions.  Unfortunately, your ineptitude has allowed our targets to escape death.  Fortunately, they will need time to recover from the battle.  During this time, they will be unable to command any of the Rebellion forces.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_00,Our probes are reporting that several Rebel capital ships have been spotted in orbit above a Rebel-controlled planet.  We cannot allow the Rebellion to grow unchallenged.  I need you to seek this fleet out and dispatch at least 3 of these ships.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_PLANET_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_00,Rebel dissenters have turned one of your planets against us, commander.  Again you have failed your duties to the Empire.  Your position may soon be replaced if you cannot maintain civility on your own planets.

They have managed to overthrow the local forces and sworn allegiance to this Rebellion.  You will receive special compensation for quelling this uprising.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_REVOLT_02,Excellent.  It seems you have a bit of a following amongst the troops.  Several units have requested reassignment to your command.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_REVOLT_TITLE,Rebel Revolt
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SABOTAGE_01,We need to send an emissary to help convince others of their wrongdoing.  Your tactics leave room for improvement.  It is always best to weaken the enemy prior to battle.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SABOTAGE_TITLE,Rebel Sabotage

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_01,Bounty hunters have tracked down Han Solo.  The traitorous smuggler is apparently in the company of the Rebellion.  This scoundrel has stolen countless credits and supplies from the Empire.  He must be punished for his crimes.  Destroy him and any Rebellion accomplices.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_02,Your actions have been successful.  You have managed to cleanse the Rebel presence from this planet, however, word comes to us that Han Solo managed to survive.  You are treading on thin ice, commander.  Due to your incompetence, I will finish the job and take the planet surface.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_TITLE,Rebel Smuggler
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_STRUCTURE_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the traitorous Rebellion.  Fleets, ground troops and secondary structures all play a part in defense.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_STRUCTURE_01,I am sure the Emperor would thank you if he was present.  I believe you will find these new troops useful.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,Your service to the Empire is noted.  While you continue your extermination of the Rebels, I'd like you to field test this new tech.  Your tech level has been raised.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_01,We have discovered a traitor in our midst.  He was discovered funneling classified information to the Rebellion.  Incompetence has allowed him to escape to Rebel territory.  Destroy all Rebellion resistance on the Rebellion planet harboring him.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_02,The traitor has been found and justice is being administered.  Let this be a lesson as to what happens to those who turn their backs on the Empire.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_TITLE,Imperial Traitor
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_00,Once again the Rebellion shows its laughable grasp of military strategy.  They have left one of their traitorous worlds poorly defended and I am assigning you to make them pay for this error.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_01,Your lack of urgency has allowed the Rebel scum to recognize their weakness and construct a defense!  Were my orders somehow unclear?  I will be personally informing the Emperor of your incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_02,It's a trap!  Bolster your defenses to survive the battle.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,Your actions have been adequately successful.  Our scientists have put together a few new weapons that I need tested.  I will require a full report of course.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNITS_00,Credits sitting unspent do not work for the Empire; only the armies that money can produce are useful.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have saved me time and resources.  It is only fair that I allow you to share in the surplus funding.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,Our space stations and ground bases are the backbone of the galaxy's defenses.  We need to increase our strength if we are to teach the Rebellion that their cause is a losing proposition.  Upgrade a starbase to strengthen our defenses.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,You handled that well.  I am directing some of the Imperial funds recovered from the Rebellion to your accounts.  Use them well.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_STATION1,Allowing the building of light frigates, this small shipyard is readily available on planets anywhere in the galaxy. While it cannot build larger ships as heavier shipyards can, its small size means that it can be built on planets that cannot support the heavier shipyards making it far more common and easily sacrificed if the situation demands it.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_STATION2,Allowing the building of heavy frigates, this larger shipyard can be built on a small number of planets across the galaxy. Its production line has been expanded by nature of its larger size, allowing for the production of large ships that do not quite meet the criteria for being capital ships .

TEXT_TOOLTIP_STATION3,Allows the building of capital ships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_STATION4,Allowing the building of massive dreadnoughts, this enormous shipyard can only be built on a handful of planets across the entire galaxy.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SYSTEM_CONTROL,System Control
TEXT_TOOLTIP_T_WING,Originally designed by Hoersch-Kessel as a replacement for the A-wing, the R-60 T-wing failed to live up to expectations due to its low shielding, hull integrity, limited maneuverability, and poor navicomputer.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_T2B,Medium tank armed with rapid-fire laser cannons. Successor design to the T1-B that focusses on anti-infantry work. Repulsorlift engines allow it to maneuver quickly, but its light quad-gun is best suited to engaging smaller threats.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_T2-M,The T2-M tank is a T2-B chassis refitted with a multi-missile launcher for anti-air purposes. Like the T2-B, it lacks heavy armor and strong shields, but can utilize its high speeds to escape enemy fire.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_T3B_TRACKEDTANK,Heavy battle tank based on an updated and grounded T1 Chassis. Early models were originally repulsorcraft, but switching to tracks for newer versions allowed additional armor and systems to be added at the cost of mobility. Expensive for the Rebel Alliance to prcocur, but sees more use in the better funded New Republic. Well suited to frontline combat, as little short of an AT-AT can stand up to it
TEXT_TOOLTIP_T4B,Heavy battle tank armed with a more rounded armament then the T3-B. The design was initially sold to planetary forces, and aquired by the Rebel Alliance when they raided a facility on Aridus.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_BOMBER,Bomber armed with proton torpedoes. Replaces the unpopular TIE/gt model and is a significant improvement over that design. Best used to attack the larger enemy ships and space stations, along with bombing runs against ground targets.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_CRAWLER,Also known as the "Century Tank". Medium tank intended to make use of surplus TIE components and production lines, the use of starship-grade components provide surprising durability. Cockpit-mounted low-slung weaponry makes it a poor choice on uneven terrain, but in an open field provide it with hefty firepower matching other tanks.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_DEFENDER,The most advanced heavy fighter-bomber available to the Empire. It boasts formidable firepower, and can hold its own against most ships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_DROID,Fully automated interceptor used extensively by reborn Palpatine. Like the standard TIE Fighter, Droids are lightly armed with twin laser cannons, but offer superior armor and speed. Best used en-masse to engage enemy fighters and bombers.

Cheap, but lacks shielding and adequate armor compared to other designs. Best used en-masse to engage enemy fighters and bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_GT,Original Sienar bomber in the early days of the New Order. Has a small payload which made it unpopular leading to quick replacement by the TIE Bomber.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_HEAVY_BOMBER,A straightforward and modular development of an ordinary TIE Bomber that sports twice the weapon pods.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_HUNTER,A speedy, heavily armed fighter originally designed for use by the Storm Commandos. Performs similarily to the ubiquitious X-wing it imitates, but is more suited to engaging enemy capital ships.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_INTERCEPTOR,Extremely fast and maneuverable interceptor. Originally intended to replace the TIE/ln, but relegated to supplementing it instead due to logistical problems. Armed with laser cannons, it is an extremely deadly threat to Rebel starfighters in a dogfight.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_MAULER,Fast light assault vehicle. Purpose-built design intended to cash in on the ground vehicle market for Sienar. Unusual design which earned its common name by being used to roadkill infantry and civilian formations. It lacks the material quality and durability of the Century tank, and cockpit lasers make it best used to close in against infantry or on flat terrain.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_OPPRESSOR,Maneuverable light bomber introduced after the Battle of Yavin. Compared to the TIE/sa Bomber, it lacks anti-ship munitions but is faster, more durable and more able to defend itself from fighters.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_SCOUT,Long-range scout fighter armed with light laser cannons. What it lacks in firepower, it makes up for in speed, maneuverability, and armor. It can safely scout areas more quickly than any other ship.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_SENTINEL,A novel TIE variant based around a pair of heavy turrets. Though somewhat clumsy, the Sentinel's shield and sturdy hull allow it to stay intact while the turrets engage nimbler foes. The Sentinel is famous beyond its deployment due to being the subject of the painting Emperor's Eyes.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_TARGETER,A light bomber based on the frame of a standard TIE Fighter. Unpopular design with poor performance that was relegated to backwater postings as soon as possible once the TIE/sa became available.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_TERROR,Long-range special forces assault fighter originally made for Darth Vader's Terror Project. Not as much ordnance as other TIE Bomber models, but a better dogfighter. Well suited to engaging any target.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIERCE,A cloned former Imperial Guard implanted with Thrawn's strategic genius, Tierce is the true leader of the Sinister Triumvirate. Financially backed by Moff Disra, he uses the conman Flim to impersonate Thrawn and control the Empire. While only a shadow of Thrawn's true genius, he remains physically and mentally very competent.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIGELLINUS,Tigellinus was one of the original 12 Grand Admirals. Like Ishin-Il-Raz, he was more known for his political savvy than actual military ability, though he was a competent commander. Though Thrawn and Palpatine had planned it, it was Tigellinus's work that got Thrawn exiled to the Unknown Regions.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TOLSIVRON, Tol Sivron was once part of the Twi'lek Clan Council before serving with Grand Moff Tarkin. Though unimaginative, Sivron was an excellent bureaucrat and manager and ran the secret weapons facility at the Maw Installation.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TORPEDO_SPHERE,Large siege platform typically assigned to Imperial sector fleets. Intended to cause precision overloads in planetary shields to strike generators in sieges, but also works as a artillery platform in space combat.

When you are prepared, capture N'zoth. Be careful when deciding whether or not to bring heroes to battles, as if they are killed they are dead for good, unless they are scheduled to upgrade their ship. This will be elaborated on later.

TEXT_TUTORIAL_CORPORATIONS,In Galactic Conquest, your main shipyard planet starts with the headquarters of your faction's main shipbuilding corporation; Mon Calamari Shipyards for the New Republic on Mon Calamari, Sycan Engineering Systems for the Empire of the Hand on Syca, and Kuat Drive Yards for the Imperial Remnant on Kuat. These provide significant bonuses to production of that company's products on those planets. Once destroyed, they can not be rebuilt.
TEXT_TUTORIAL_ERAS,In Thrawn's Revenge, tech levels have been replaced with eras based on the Imperial Leader. These are Isard, Thrawn, Palpatine's Clone, Daala and Pellaeon. To advance in era, kill the Imperial leader. This is only possible in the Art of War GC, or scenarios not based around specific conflicts. In order to see which eras are available in a GC, check the description before starting the GC. In this GC, Thrawn is the leader, stationed at Bastion. Invade and kill Thrawn in order to proceed.
TEXT_TUTORIAL_OBJ1,Current Objective: Build a Capital Shipyard on Mon Calamari
TEXT_TUTORIAL_OBJ2,Current Objective: Invade N'zoth
TEXT_TUTORIAL_OBJ3,Current Objective: Kill Thrawn over Bastion
TEXT_TUTORIAL_OPEN,Welcome to Thrawn's Revenge. In this tutorial, you will learn about the major changes made to Empire at War by the mod. This assumes a basic familiarity with Empire at War and strategy games in general, so if you do not have that, we suggest playing through the Empire at War tutorials first.
TEXT_TUTORIAL_REWARD,You can also gain rewards for capturing specific planets. These can be infrastructure, credits, or even special units. Non-Playable factions, such as the Yevetha on N'zoth, play a large role in many GC scenarios, and capturing their planets grants free Aramadia Thrustships, for example.
TEXT_TUTORIAL_SHIPYARDS,In Thrawn's Revenge, Space Stations have been replaced with Shipyards, which produce ships but have no offensive or defensive capabilities and Golan space defense platforms. There are 3 levels to each, and each planet can only build to a certain level. Mon Calamari can build up to Capital Shipyards, and currently has a Heavy Frigate Shipyard. Upgrade your shipyard now from the space tab.

TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_05,TASK: Build a Defiler. 
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_08,TASK: Drag your new Defiler unit to Honoghr and drop him in the 'SPREAD CORRUPTION' context-sensitive slot.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_10,The Zann Consortium gains numerous benefits from corruption.  While taking control of planets is necessary for production, only corruption is necessary to gain credits.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_11,On the galactic level, corruption produces a steady stream of income for each planet corrupted.  In addition, it creates an artificial trade route between all corrupted planets, and allows Zann Consortium fleets to travel through enemy worlds using bribery.  Corruption also acts as a limited spy network - you can view certain details of enemy planets and their contents.  Corruption has a detrimental effect on the Empire's production time and the Alliance's production costs.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_12,In tactical combat, corruption gives the Zann Consortium a cash bounty for every Imperial and Rebel unit destroyed in battle.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_13,Your enemies also gain certain benefits from your corruption: smugglers on corrupted worlds do not disappear over time; bounty hunters gain discounts to their hero removal and units produced at Cantinas and Hutt Palaces cost less.  Also, you cannot produce units on worlds you do not actually control, and controlling worlds do not give as large a financial gain as just corrupting them.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_14,Certain enemy heroes prevent corruption from taking hold, and many enemy heroes can remove corruption given time.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_15,Honoghr is now under the corrupting influence of Tyber Zann.  Note that you can now see more information about the planet, and your daily income has increased.  Corrupt other worlds to make even more of a profit, but beware - both enemy factions can see your corruption.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_22,TASK: Use a Defiler to set up a Racketeering operation on Shola.

TEXT_UW_ACT01_G02_12,Striking Back at Jabba
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G02_13,Jabba thought that he could absorb all my planets and take control of the Consortium.  Shola was one of my storage houses for contraband, and Jabba wasted no time in stealing everything I had there.  Unfortunately, Urai chose Shola as the hiding place for the Sith Artifact I stole - we need to get it back and destroy Jabba's forces there before they manage to uncover it.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G03_08,TASK: Take a fleet including Tyber Zann to Yavin 4.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G03_09,HINT: Remember that you can corrupt planets in a chain and bribe planets to let you pass without battle.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_01,TASK: Use a Defiler to establish a Black Market on Kuat.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_02,TASK: Drag Tyber Zann to the BUY slot on Kuat.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_04,TASK: Purchase Disruptor Technology.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_05,HINT: After accessing the Black Market your hero is removed from the game temporarily.  The amount of time they remain out of play depends on the hero.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_06,The Zann Consortium advances their technology differently than the other factions.  While all of their units are generally available from the beginning, the special abilities must be purchased from the black market.  In this way the units become more powerful as the game advances.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_07,To enter the Black Market, you must first spread corruption on a system.  Once corrupted, you can drag Tyber Zann or Urai Fen, and some other heroes to the Black Market context sensitive slot.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_08,Different heroes have different effects on the Black Market.  Tyber Zann lowers the tech level requirement of technology one level, while Urai Fen can gain tech more quickly.  Of course, these abilities have a large effect on the price you pay.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_09,Tyber Zann has accessed the black market.  Since Kuat belongs to the Empire, you will only see technology that they control.  Rebel-controlled planets will have different technology available.  Note that some of the advances are relatively cheap, while others are extremely expensive.  Each ability has an associated enemy tech level - the Zann Consortium has no tech level of its own.  Because of this, the Zann Consortium must balance its expansion with the need for new tech.  Once the Empire's tech level advances, the price of the tech associated with that level is cut dramatically.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_10,HINT: Note that you can hover the mouse over each tech advancement to see what it does and which of the Zann Consortium units will be affected by it.
